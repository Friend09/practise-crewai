As a seasoned AI/ML Engineer with over 10 years of experience in Agile Project Management, 4+ years in data science, and 10 years in business systems analysis, I am excited to bring my comprehensive expertise in advanced data and machine learning solutions to the AI/Machine Learning Engineer - Manager role at EY. My career has been defined by a commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology and advanced analytics to solve complex challenges, drive innovation, and enhance decision-making across business functions.

Throughout my tenure at Marsh McLennan, I successfully transformed business needs into actionable, data-driven insights and machine learning models, driving significant value across various business lines. I have a deep proficiency in Python for data analysis, visualization, and API integration, which has been instrumental in developing scalable solutions, particularly for natural language processing and generative AI tasks. My expertise in frameworks like LangChain and OpenAI, as well as my experience with large language models (LLMs), positions me well to guide clients through the nuances of Generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

A project that showcases my skills and hands-on problem-solving approach is the end-to-end tag prediction model I developed for ServiceNow incidents. Using ServiceNowâ€™s REST API, I extracted, preprocessed, and implemented an accurate tag prediction model that enhanced planning and reporting capabilities, boosting both automation and decision accuracy. This project reflects my experience designing and deploying complete ML workflows, including MLOps practices, model pipelines, and continuous monitoringâ€”all critical for effective machine learning engineering.

In addition to technical expertise, I have extensive experience with cloud computing platforms such as AWS, which has equipped me to lead projects involving containerization, model scaling, and deploying robust ML systems. I am proficient with DevOps tools including Git, Azure DevOps, and Agile project management platforms like Jira, which enables me to guide teams in delivering complex, feature-rich AI applications efficiently. My experience with CI/CD pipelines and test-driven development further ensures that the models I implement are not only powerful but also maintainable and resilient.

My background also includes developing intelligent applications for IT operations, such as chatbots for mean time to resolution analysis and automated ticket tagging. These initiatives demonstrate my ability to deliver impactful AI-driven solutions that improve both client outcomes and internal operational efficiencies.

I am passionate about fostering a collaborative environment and thrive in client-facing roles where I can understand unique business requirements and communicate data-driven recommendations effectively. With a solid foundation in agile methodologies, I am skilled at translating complex technical concepts for diverse audiences, which is essential for the fast-paced, client-centered consulting environment at EY.

As an AI/Machine Learning Engineer at EY, I am eager to contribute my technical knowledge, strategic insight, and mentoring experience to lead teams in delivering innovative, scalable solutions that align with EYâ€™s vision of building a better working world. My combination of technical depth, practical experience, and commitment to continuous learning will enable me to make a meaningful impact for EYâ€™s clients and broader organizational goals.
