      "Considerations for ETF trading strategies\n",
      " December 07, 2023\n",
      "The more popular ETFs become, the more important it is that investors use the right trading strategies. That’s particularly true of large trades, which have the potential to move an ETF’s price. Large trades can be quite complex and, if mishandled, can create negative consequences for an investor’s portfolio.\n",
      "For example, Vanguard’s ETF Capital Markets Desk gets a lot of calls from advisors about large trade orders to rebalance client portfolios. Rebalancing trades may recur—say, quarterly—or they may be used strategically when markets are volatile. Advisors often ask how they can minimize transaction costs as they rebalance clients’ ETF portfolios to achieve their targeted allocations.\n",
      "As investors continue to shift to ETFs, larger block trades are hitting the market more frequently.1 This means that getting the trading piece right is more important than ever.\n",
      "Industry mutual fund and ETF assets and net cash flows, 2013–2023\n",
      "Notes: Mutual fund and ETF assets under management data are as of August 31, 2023. Ten-year net flows data cover August 31, 2013, through August 31, 2023.\n",
      "Sources: Vanguard, based on data from Morningstar, Inc.\n",
      "The right tool for the job\n",
      "Just as carpenters have unique tools in their toolbox for specific jobs, investors have different trading strategies at their disposal for different types of transactions. It’s important to choose the tools that will most help you execute your ETF order and incur the lowest transaction costs possible.\n",
      "Crucially, big and small ETF trades are not necessarily handled the same way. Smaller ETF trades typically use “low-touch” orders, which can be self-provisioned by executing either limit orders or market orders. Larger ETF block trades generally take a “high-touch” approach.2 High-touch trades may require working with a custodian’s block trading desk to execute the ETF order with greater discretion.\n",
      "Common low-touch ETF order types\n",
      "Market order: An order to buy or sell a security immediately at the best available current price. The priorities for this type of order are speed and execution, not price. These are popular among individual investors who want to buy or sell ETFs without delay. The primary risk associated with this order type is the impact on price.\n",
      "Limit order: An order to buy a security at no more than—or sell a security at no less than—a specified price. This gives the investor some control over the price at which the trade is executed and can safeguard against unexpected market volatility.\n",
      "Marketable limit order: A limit order that is placed for immediate execution. For a marketable buy limit order, the limit price is set at or above the ask price—the price at which the security is offered for sale. For a marketable sell limit order, the limit price is set at or below the bid—the price a prospective buyer is willing to pay.\n",
      "Common high-touch ETF order types\n",
      "Risk trade: A trade at a negotiated price for a block of ETF shares, in which the market maker—a dealer firm that maintains specified bid and ask prices and can buy or sell at publicly quoted prices—commits capital to facilitate the investor’s order immediately. Generally, risk trades occur at a slight premium or discount to the quoted spread or national best bid and offer (NBBO) at the time of the trade.\n",
      "Algorithmic trades (algos): Trading strategies that use automated algorithms to try to achieve specific execution outcomes. Algo trades are generally executed over time and are intended to minimize price impact in the market. Three common algo strategies are:\n",
      "VWAP trade—Volume-weighted average price, based on a security’s average trading price throughout the day and accounting for trade volume.\n",
      "TWAP trade—Time-weighted average price, based on average trading price for evenly divided time slots to try to minimize market impact.\n",
      "POV trade—Percent of volume, using partial orders based on a user-defined participation ratio and market volume.        \n",
      "Check the ETF’s liquidity profile\n",
      "Deciding whether to use low-touch or high-touch orders depends on how big the investor’s planned trade is compared with the ETF’s liquidity profile, or how easily the ETF’s shares can be quickly bought or sold at a price reflecting its intrinsic value. If the trade amount exceeds 5% of the ETF’s average daily volume (ADV), a few other considerations are important before submitting an order. An investor with experience submitting low-touch market orders in this scenario may wish to consider marketable limit orders instead. These are limit orders priced for immediate execution.3\n",
      "Anyone considering a marketable limit order for a relatively large trade should understand whether enough shares are available in the secondary market to readily absorb the trade. For sellers, the offer should not greatly exceed the shares on the bid; for buyers, the request should not greatly outnumber the shares on the offer. Too large an order could show too much information to the market, which could work against execution quality.\n",
      "It may still be possible, though, to execute a low-touch trade that is much larger than the quoted size in the secondary market. This would be in the form of a not held limit order. Such orders allow investors to stipulate the price at which they’re willing to execute the trade and protect against unintentional price impact, while not revealing the full size of the trade to the market. If bids or offers don’t materialize at the desired price, the trade won’t happen, thus avoiding any unexpected ETF executions.\n",
      "Big trades often require high-touch orders\n",
      "The adjacent decision tree can help an investor determine whether a high-touch or low-touch order is most suitable. If the trade size exceeds both 5% of ADV and the quoted size available on the bid/offer, the investor may also need to consider whether the order is large enough to result in the creation or redemption of ETF shares.4\n",
      "ETF trading decision tree\n",
      "Source: Vanguard.\n",
      "The power of order aggregation\n",
      "Vanguard occasionally sees a trading style applied to ETFs that has traditionally been used for mutual fund portfolios—submitting batch orders all at once at the same time each day.5 Although this works for mutual funds priced once a day at the fund’s net asset value (NAV), it may not be the best solution for ETFs. Rebalancing numerous portfolios and submitting countless low-touch trades for a single ETF at the same time runs the risk of affecting the ETF’s price and resulting in higher transaction costs for the end investor.\n",
      "One useful trading technique that can make rebalancing ETF portfolios across numerous investor accounts more efficient is order aggregation—the simple concept of taking numerous orders on the same ETF and the same side of the market and aggregating them into a single trade.\n",
      "Not only does this minimize the operational challenges of submitting multiple trades across various investor accounts, but it also provides more trade flexibility in using high-touch orders to help achieve the best execution.\n",
      "Takeaways\n",
      "The great benefit of intraday trading should be balanced with the right trading strategy.\n",
      "As the use of ETFs increases and larger trades become more frequent, investors have an opportunity to perfect how they approach big trades such as rebalancing trades. Investors who weigh different trade considerations carefully to avoid any surprises and achieve the best execution can potentially increase the chances for optimal outcomes.\n",
      "Using the ETF trading decision tree can help avoid an unexpected ETF execution.\n",
      "1 Definitions of large or block trades can vary. Some exchanges define block trades as any trade over 10,000 shares. Custodian requirements are often tied to the percentage of the average daily trading volume (ADV), share quantity, or dollar value of the trade. For example, any trade representing 5% or more of an ETF’s ADV would be considered a large trade that should involve consultation with a block trading desk.\n",
      "2 Low-touch orders refer to “held orders” that are held to the national best bid and offer (NBBO) price. High-touch orders give your broker time and price discretion to execute the order and aim to achieve the best price available. They are also called “not held” orders, since they are not held to the NBBO.\n",
      "3 Vanguard suggests that investors consider using limit orders or marketable limit orders to avoid any unexpected ETF executions. In Vanguard’s view, marketable limit orders may represent the best of both worlds in that executions are quick and include safeguards that market orders lack.\n",
      "4 ETFs are created and redeemed in unit sizes. Generally, 25,000 ETF shares is the minimum to facilitate a creation or redemption; however, creation unit size can vary by product.\n",
      "5 Batch orders refer to the systematic submission of numerous low-touch (held) orders to the market all at once. This trading strategy can often affect the ETF price and signal the market if the trades are consistently submitted at the same time of day.\n",

It is crucial to define specific buying and selling rules and apply them consistently throughout the backtesting period. This allows investors to identify patterns and trends, as well as potential flaws in the strategy. Additionally, backtesting can help optimize strategies by modifying parameters and measuring the impact on returns.

Prioritize risk management strategies to ensure a well-rounded investment portfolio.\n",
      "Tailored Tactics for Personalized Investment Success\n",
      "Developing customized trading strategies is key to success in the financial markets. Traders need to adapt to changing market conditions and tailor their approach accordingly.

Combination strategies, such as using both momentum and mean reversion, can also be employed. VOO, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index, can be a valuable asset in developing customized trading strategies. Traders can use VOO as a benchmark to compare their strategy's performance and make informed decisions.

      "How to use technical analysis to improve your trading?\n",
      "Technical analysis is a method used by traders to predict future price movements in the financial markets. To improve your trading using technical analysis, start by understanding different technical indicators such as moving averages, trend lines, and support/resistance levels. Analyze charts to identify patterns and trends that can signal potential buying or selling opportunities. Additionally, use tools like oscillators to gauge overbought or oversold conditions. Combine multiple indicators and patterns to increase the accuracy of your predictions. Continuously monitor and update your analysis to adapt to market dynamics. Regularly backtest your strategies to refine and improve your trading decisions.\n",
      "What is the best time to trade VOO?\n",
      "The best time to trade VOO, an ETF that tracks the S&P 500, is typically during the regular trading hours of the U.S. stock market, which is 9:30 am to 4:00 pm Eastern Time from Monday to Friday. This is when the market is most liquid and volatility is higher, providing traders with better opportunities for executing trades at desired prices. It is advisable to avoid trading during pre-market or after-hours sessions as liquidity and price stability may be reduced. Additionally, keeping an eye on major economic releases or corporate news during trading hours can help make more informed decisions.\n",
      "What is the 1% trading strategy?\n",
      "The 1% trading strategy, also known as the 1% rule, is a risk management technique used by traders and investors. It suggests that one should never risk more than 1% of their total trading capital on any single trade. This strategy aims to limit potential losses and preserve capital. By adhering to this rule, traders can protect themselves from significant drawdowns and allow for better risk-reward ratios. Ultimately, the 1% trading strategy promotes disciplined and responsible trading practices.\n",
      "What's the most popular trading strategy?\n",
      "The most popular trading strategy is difficult to pinpoint as it varies depending on the individual's goals and risk tolerance. However, some commonly utilized strategies include trend following, mean reversion, and breakout trading. Trend following involves identifying and riding market trends, while mean reversion seeks to profit from the reversion of asset prices to their average value. Breakout trading focuses on identifying price levels where an asset is expected to surge or decline sharply. Ultimately, the choice of strategy depends on the trader's preference, experience, and the prevailing market conditions.\n",
      "Where do you trade VOO?\n",
      "You can trade VOO, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 index, on major stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ.

      "Building resilient portfolios through diversification\n",
      " March 26, 2024\n",
      "Greg Davis\n",
      "Vanguard President and Chief Investment Officer\n",
      "After a period of relative market calm, market dynamics in the last few years have called into question the viability of traditional allocation models like 60% stocks/40% bonds and the conventional roles of asset classes. Cash delivered record returns, bonds fell in tandem with stocks in 2022, and U.S. equities continue to outpace international securities. The speed at which the landscape changed, as central banks attacked inflation with higher interest rates, serves as a strong reminder of why investors need to resist the temptation to chase performance and why portfolio diversification remains as important as ever.\n",
      "Equities\n",
      "U.S. equities have contributed to much of the overall market performance since the global financial crisis in 2008–2009. The low interest rate environment, rising stock valuations, and high earnings in the U.S. allowed a broadly diversified U.S. stock portfolio to return almost twice as much as a comparable international portfolio over the past decade.\n",
      "U.S. equities continue to be a strong performer, but the drivers of that outperformance over the last decade have likely sown the seeds for more muted performance over the coming one. With stretched valuations and a slowdown in earnings growth, we’re forecasting annualized returns of 3.7%–5.7% in the U.S. equity market over the next decade. Investors should be cautious with U.S. equities, considering the expensive valuations and lower expected growth. By comparison, we anticipate returns of 6.9%–8.9% annualized over the next decade for international equities because of the multidimensional growth opportunities given lower volatility, cheaper valuations, and higher potential for growth.\n",
      "Fixed income\n",
      "Historically, bonds have served as a stabilizer for a portfolio because there’s usually less volatility risk in fixed income than in equities. Over the past decade or so, investors shied away from bonds in favor of cash and cash equivalents. But bonds and cash serve separate and distinct purposes. Over the long term, high-quality bond funds have tended to offer better diversification against stock volatility and higher yield potential than cash. While replacing bonds with cash may work in the short term, investors need to consider more than just yield if they want to design an all-weather portfolio.\n",
      "Current economic conditions have made fixed income a more viable asset class that can grow over time and compound your returns for medium- to long-term savings needs. Global bond markets have repriced significantly over the last two years as interest rates increased, putting bond valuations close to fair. We expect both U.S. and international bonds to return a nominal annualized 3.9%–4.9% over the next decade. While we expect similar returns for U.S. and international fixed income, it’ll remain important to diversify because international bonds can mitigate overall volatility and improve portfolio outcomes through lower correlations.\n",
      "Cash\n",
      "Investors should think of cash as the tool to manage liquidity risk—it can be a strategic allocation for day-to-day needs, for emergency savings, or for those with a very low risk tolerance. Cash should not be considered a substitute for stocks or bonds in any market environment, even in the current high interest rate environment, where investors have been able to get a real return on cash.\n",
      "On the face of it, shifting your portfolio to cash seems like a good idea in this environment: There is no risk in cash and you’re getting the same return you might from bonds—for now. But cash is limited in its ability to keep up with inflation and investing in cash means forgoing risk premium. Investors must also consider the durability of the yield, which is anchored to monetary policy. If central banks cut interest rates, the yield on cash decreases, and you’ll miss out on the income you would have earned if you had maintained your target bond allocation.\n",
      "The current economic and market environment is primed to tempt investors to consider forgoing their strategy in order to chase returns. But across and within asset classes, we can’t account for everything, such as how an AI-led productivity boom or geopolitical events could affect returns. Market leadership is not guaranteed, and chasing returns can leave investors exposed to unnecessary volatility and risk. Our research shows that a balanced mix of diversified assets, combined with a disciplined, cost-conscious approach to investing, can help improve investors’ chances of achieving their long-term investment goals, as long as they stay the course.\n",

Combine multiple indicators and patterns to increase the accuracy of your predictions. Continuously monitor and update your analysis to adapt to market dynamics. Regularly backtest your strategies to refine and improve your trading decisions.\n",
      "What is the best time to trade VOO?\n",
      "The best time to trade VOO, an ETF that tracks the S&P 500, is typically during the regular trading hours of the U.S. stock market, which is 9:30 am to 4:00 pm Eastern Time from Monday to Friday. This is when the market is most liquid and volatility is higher, providing traders with better opportunities for executing trades at desired prices. It is advisable to avoid trading during pre-market or after-hours sessions as liquidity and price stability may be reduced. Additionally, keeping an eye on major economic releases or corporate news during trading hours can help make more informed decisions.\n",
      "What is the 1% trading strategy?\n",
      "The 1% trading strategy, also known as the 1% rule, is a risk management technique used by traders and investors. It suggests that one should never risk more than 1% of their total trading capital on any single trade. This strategy aims to limit potential losses and preserve capital. By adhering to this rule, traders can protect themselves from significant drawdowns and allow for better risk-reward ratios. Ultimately, the 1% trading strategy promotes disciplined and responsible trading practices.\n",
      "What's the most popular trading strategy?\n",
      "The most popular trading strategy is difficult to pinpoint as it varies depending on the individual's goals and risk tolerance. However, some commonly utilized strategies include trend following, mean reversion, and breakout trading. Trend following involves identifying and riding market trends, while mean reversion seeks to profit from the reversion of asset prices to their average value. Breakout trading focuses on identifying price levels where an asset is expected to surge or decline sharply. Ultimately, the choice of strategy depends on the trader's preference, experience, and the prevailing market conditions.\n",
      "Where do you trade VOO?\n",
      "You can trade VOO, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 index, on major stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ. These exchanges offer a platform for investors to buy and sell VOO shares. Additionally, various online brokerage firms provide access to trade VOO through their trading platforms. It's important to note that trading VOO, like any other ETF, should be done through a reliable and regulated financial institution.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "In conclusion, trading strategies for VOO, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, are essential for investors looking to maximize returns and manage risks effectively. By utilizing technical analysis, automated trading strategies, and risk management techniques, traders can make informed decisions and capitalize on market opportunities swiftly.

The Trading Strategies page shows hypothetical trading results from each of the 13 technical indicators analyzed through the Barchart Opinions. Using this page, you can see hypothetical profit or loss that would have resulted following the Buy/Sell signals given by the Opinions. Each of the 13 indicators are back-tested for a period of five years, and the results are summarized for each indicator showing the total number of hypothetical trades, average days per trade and total profit or loss from the trades. The performance results of ALL the indicators are then summarized at the bottom of the page, to give you an Average Performance Summary of how the Opinions would have done over the past five years.

Barchart Opinions Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. Each Opinion requires more than 200 active trading days to run the prices through 13 different technical indicators; for futures, the contract must have more than 100 trading days. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell or Hold value for the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. The Short, Medium and Long term indicators are grouped together and calculated separately for their groups. The Performance Summary is a composite of all 13 studies listed on the page. Opinions are updated every 20 minutes throughout the day, using delayed data from the exchanges.  Barchart Symbol Notes Tutorial (8:43) Want to use this as your default charts setting?

      "The covered call strategy can be used as a reasonable hedge for lower volatility securities. The hedge exists as the premium that is received to lower the cost basis / break-even point of your holdings... but you are only hedged by that amount. It is a great means to generate income on your holdings and act as a 2nd dividend or 2nd income on the shares in your account. \n",
      "Regarding the Money on the Table Report... The sell-to-open call enters you into an obligation to potentially deliver your shares of stock at the sold call strike price. If you wanted to hold the position long term and not worry about rolling or adjusting the call too often, you would likely just stay with Out of the Money (above the current underlying price) looking for a lower probability of assignment. This would mean a lower premium and thus a lower hedge. \n",
      "The Conservative approach means you would be selling a call In the Money to begin with, below the current price. This gives a higher premium due to the intrinsic value and time value of the option premium. However, if you do not want to have your shares assigned you would need to roll the call up to a higher strike price and further out in time. This might cost a higher premium than you initially received. \n",
      "The covered call strategy is a popular and potentially valuable instrument for shares of stock that you own. Note: The most efficient hedge against an optionable stock or ETF in your account is the Married Put strategy.\n",

      "VOO trade ideasVideos onlyVideos onlyInvestment Club FSC Just a collection of 2022 spring semester FSC investment club equities. by cautiousLeader89817110How to Invest in the S&P 500 [FOR DUMMIES]In the investment world everybody expects you to know exactly how to buy into an Index Fund, which makes it very hard to find a good detailed non-outdated resource to learn from. While it’s easy to do once your set up, learning how to from nothing was difficult (at least for me). \n",
      "Before you even think about investing into the S&P 500 you need to know WHY. Because if you don't know WHY your investing into this you will panic sell when its the best time to be buying. Now while this part can be answered by a YouTube video I put some of the main reasons below.\n",
      "- The s&p 500 is a diverse Index Fund. (The term index fund means a portfolio set up for you to invest in.)\n",
      "- The s&p 500 holds the top 500 USA companies. (The diversity in big companies makes it a safe investment in the long term.)\n",
      "- The s&p 500, over a 15-year period, beat nearly 90% of actively managed investment funds. (Meaning us noobies can beat the pros!)\n",
      "- The S&P 500 has always recovered, there are lost decades which the market has stayed down for 10 years but in those 10 years you could be buying every single month! (Dollar Cost Averaging)\n",
      "- With the power of compounding your money will grow exponentially. \n",
      "Now what is Dollar Cost Averaging..? Dollar Cost Averaging is buying roughly equal amounts of an asset per month. Doesn't have to be equal but nothing to different, for example you don't want to buy $500 worth's one month and $1000 worth's another (only spend what you know you can be consistent with in the future). Dollar-cost averaging is a great investing strategy because, in the long term, it can protect the investor (you) from market volatility (up and down movement) and reduce the amount you'll spend buying shares. So, over time, you will end up investing in more assets for less.\n",
      "Now what is compounding..? Compounding is re-investing both your capital gains and dividends in order to get a higher payout the next time around again and again and again.. till your rich. Although with compounding comes a catch; if you panic sell before your desired target you've fell into your own trap, because compounding depends on time, and you just smashed the watch. Plus, you should never panic sell when the market crashes; be happy you’re getting everything on a sale!\n",
      "Now we have reviewed why you should invest into the S&P 500, what dollar cost averaging is, what compounding is, and why panic selling is stupid. But how do you buy it?!?\n",
      "I started by trying a brokerage called Vanguard. (a brokerage company is pretty much a middleman that connects buyers and sellers). I wanted to use Vanguard because I knew that I wanted low purchase fees; low purchase fees are good because in the long term it impacts how much you’re actually investing (less fees = more invested long term). Now let me tell you this, vanguard SUCKS, their customer service is terrible, the website is terrible, and they wouldn't even let me open an account for god’s sake because \"their website was down\". The only thing good about them is their index funds and low fees. What took me a while to learn was that I can purchase the SAME index funds but with a different broker. Now I do recommend you get an account with Charles Schwab they have real branches you can go to and ask questions in (not just a phone number like Vanguard) plus if you do want to call their wait time isn't over an hour like Vanguard, and their website is user friendly.\n",
      "How to make an account with Charles Schwab..? Search up \"Charles Schwab\", click on their website, Open an Account, and decide what type of brokerage account you want (if your just one person pick individual), then continue with the steps. If you’re below the age of 18 search up \"create a custodial account Charles Schwab\" and start from there, you will need your parents SSN, and other info.\n",
      "Now that you have a basic account set up your ready to invest; but wait there's more. You currently have a brokerage account which means your eligible to invest however much you want per year, although once you pull the money out you will be taxed on it based off your tax bracket. Along with your brokerage account you should set up a Roth IRA account. A Roth IRA account is a retirement account in short, your allowed to invest up to $6000 per year into it and once your 50 you can pull it out TAX FREE. (if you pull it out any sooner it will act as a brokerage account and tax you, so don't do that). Making a Roth IRA account requires paperwork which you fill in and then go to one of the many \"Charles Schwab Branches\" to turn in. You can ask customer support to send you the paperwork to your email which you must print out. This account pretty much assures you will be a millionaire at retirement.\n",
      "Ok I have both accounts.. now how to buy? Click on \"trade\", make sure you’re on the \"Stocks & ETFs\" Tab, click the \"symbol search bar\", and type \"VOO\" (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF). Now decide on how many shares you want (you can check the price here on trading view). It will have an option to turn on auto-reinvest dividends make sure to click that, & make sure you select \"Market Order\" so you get filled in immediately then click \"order\".\n",
      "Always invest the maximum of 6K into your Roth IRA and invest as much as you can into your brokerage account. Every 3 months re-invest your capital gains on both accounts.\n",
      "You can see how much your projected to earn in the future. Search up \"compounding calculator\" put in how much you’re going to be investing per month, how long, and at a 10% average rate of return.\n",
      "I hope this helps, comment and like. :)\n",

      "Who knows what will happen next but my prediction is that VOO will go either up down or sideways.by EERIK111Never time The Market, right?When it comes to your long term portfolio, please Dollar Cost Average into the S&P 500. Which I will explain how to in detail in my next post.\n",
      "However today I just want to show a small swing trading strategy theory I will try for fun. The reason I prefer the idea of swing trading is because it requires you to set your candle sticks to 4h,1d, or sometimes even 1 week. This is good because the more time range each candle stick has the more significance a simple trading pattern will have. In other words trend lines (support/resistance) will be respected.\n",
      "Its very difficult to trade with the market average unless you have a significant amount of capital, and even then your better off on other investments/trades. That's what got my head on option trading; this is a high risk and high reward form of trading. You either lose it all or you make a big return (rough explanation). All this being said that's why I think the S&P 500 is the perfect environment for option trading. I believe if you call/put when the candle hits the trend line you will almost always win; and for breakouts you can wait for the re-bounce.\n",
      "Please let me know what you think! by pastworks1ETFs and rising concerns (TL;DR at end)ETFs are by far the most popular form of investment, regardless of whether you are a parent saving up for your child's college or you're a multi-millionaire/billionaire banker, a good portion of your investments will be in exchange traded funds, regardless of whether that fund is for commodities, industries or indexes. \n",
      "Since their first implementation in the 1990s, they've have grown rapidly as seen in the thumbnail of this idea ( AMEX:VOO ). In the words of Mr. Buffett himself, there is only one problem with index funds: \"they're boring\". You can't stand with your friends on the weekend at the barbecue and talk about all the trades you've made in response to crazy market action because you've got some fund manager who just holds the stock of everybody worth holding (in theory). All you do is put more money into it, or take money out of it.\n",
      "However, recently I came to the realisation (like many other investors), they're becoming ludicrously priced. Not just the individual price but the overall market cap with companies like Blackrock and Vanguard holding quite conceivably hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars within ETFs. Now there are concerns regarding a potential crash in the ETF market or at least the funds that trade through indeces. As far as the cause of such crash, I wouldn't dare attempt to make some degree of educated guess as anything could happen. One may consider me rather cynical when it comes to this topic but I'm sure I'm not the only person who has a problem with losing money. \n",
      "Now there is absolutely nothing one can do about a crash but there are other solutions to minimise losses especially in a market that is trading so dangerously high. I would personally (assuming I had the financial capacity) take out around 60-75% of my overall investments in ETFs and transfer them to AAA rated state issued bonds or simply reinvest the money in stocks I already hold. Then I would continue my regular dollar cost averaging approach to investment in ETFs (or whatever the frequency is that you add money to such funds) until such a crash may occur. At a given point, (depending on the fund and how severe the crash is) I would increase the frequency and amount of money I add to such funds as the price drop should cause them to appear very attractive. Understandably, many people will disagree with this approach as you are still setting yourself up to lose money (unless you remove all your money from the funds, while you still could potentially continue earning. This results in the investor being left in some sort of dilemma. Although this is another discussion for another day) and \"past performance is no indicator of future results\" but this is the approach I would take.\n",
      "As usual, other opinions, facts, news and comments are always welcome so comment away and stay safe!\n",
      "TL;DR: ETFs are trading very high in price (dangerously) and a potential crash is luring (if you have a cynical outlook).*\n",

      "Im posting VOO because it is one of my favorite long term investment holds. Every portfolio should have some Vanguard funds in it, and especially should have the VOO . But look at this. Look at the dip and rip from March 2020. Its now up almost 80%. And it will be up 80% soon.\n",

      "Buy when others are scared. Sell when others are greedy.Longby BradWeber82338S&P 500 Wave Count - End of Wave 3?Waves based on fib levels. I am assuming that we are in a Wave 3 showing an impulse with extension. Could push from 1.618 to the 1.7 level to end wave 3. I hope that we will see a correction for wave 4, but wave 4's are usually less then 38.2%. If so then we still have a solid wave 5 to go. Guessing at a standard 2.0 extension to wave 5. I also see a clear channel that if you center the mid-line it nicely aligns with the 2.0 fib level.\n",

It is crucial to define specific buying and selling rules and apply them consistently throughout the backtesting period. This allows investors to identify patterns and trends, as well as potential flaws in the strategy. Additionally, backtesting can help optimize strategies by modifying parameters and measuring the impact on returns.

Prioritize risk management strategies to ensure a well-rounded investment portfolio.\n",
      "Tailored Tactics for Personalized Investment Success\n",
      "Developing customized trading strategies is key to success in the financial markets. Traders need to adapt to changing market conditions and tailor their approach accordingly.

Traders can use VOO as a benchmark to compare their strategy's performance and make informed decisions.

      "How to use technical analysis to improve your trading?\n",
      "Technical analysis is a method used by traders to predict future price movements in the financial markets. To improve your trading using technical analysis, start by understanding different technical indicators such as moving averages, trend lines, and support/resistance levels. Analyze charts to identify patterns and trends that can signal potential buying or selling opportunities. Additionally, use tools like oscillators to gauge overbought or oversold conditions. Combine multiple indicators and patterns to increase the accuracy of your predictions. Continuously monitor and update your analysis to adapt to market dynamics. Regularly backtest your strategies to refine and improve your trading decisions.\n",
      "What is the best time to trade VOO?\n",
      "The best time to trade VOO, an ETF that tracks the S&P 500, is typically during the regular trading hours of the U.S. stock market, which is 9:30 am to 4:00 pm Eastern Time from Monday to Friday. This is when the market is most liquid and volatility is higher, providing traders with better opportunities for executing trades at desired prices. It is advisable to avoid trading during pre-market or after-hours sessions as liquidity and price stability may be reduced. Additionally, keeping an eye on major economic releases or corporate news during trading hours can help make more informed decisions.\n",
      "What is the 1% trading strategy?\n",
      "The 1% trading strategy, also known as the 1% rule, is a risk management technique used by traders and investors. It suggests that one should never risk more than 1% of their total trading capital on any single trade. This strategy aims to limit potential losses and preserve capital. By adhering to this rule, traders can protect themselves from significant drawdowns and allow for better risk-reward ratios. Ultimately, the 1% trading strategy promotes disciplined and responsible trading practices.\n",
      "What's the most popular trading strategy?\n",
      "The most popular trading strategy is difficult to pinpoint as it varies depending on the individual's goals and risk tolerance. However, some commonly utilized strategies include trend following, mean reversion, and breakout trading. Trend following involves identifying and riding market trends, while mean reversion seeks to profit from the reversion of asset prices to their average value. Breakout trading focuses on identifying price levels where an asset is expected to surge or decline sharply. Ultimately, the choice of strategy depends on the trader's preference, experience, and the prevailing market conditions.\n",
      "Where do you trade VOO?\n",
      "You can trade VOO, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 index, on major stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ. These exchanges offer a platform for investors to buy and sell VOO shares. Additionally, various online brokerage firms provide access to trade VOO through their trading platforms. It's important to note that trading VOO, like any other ETF, should be done through a reliable and regulated financial institution.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "In conclusion, trading strategies for VOO, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, are essential for investors looking to maximize returns and manage risks effectively. By utilizing technical analysis, automated trading strategies, and risk management techniques, traders can make informed decisions and capitalize on market opportunities swiftly.

Barchart Opinions Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. Each Opinion requires more than 200 active trading days to run the prices through 13 different technical indicators; for futures, the contract must have more than 100 trading days. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell or Hold value for the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. The Short, Medium and Long term indicators are grouped together and calculated separately for their groups. The Performance Summary is a composite of all 13 studies listed on the page. Opinions are updated every 20 minutes throughout the day, using delayed data from the exchanges.  Barchart Symbol Notes Tutorial (8:43) Want to use this as your default charts setting?

      "How to use technical analysis to improve your trading?\n",
      "Technical analysis is a method used by traders to predict future price movements in the financial markets. To improve your trading using technical analysis, start by understanding different technical indicators such as moving averages, trend lines, and support/resistance levels. Analyze charts to identify patterns and trends that can signal potential buying or selling opportunities. Additionally, use tools like oscillators to gauge overbought or oversold conditions. Combine multiple indicators and patterns to increase the accuracy of your predictions. Continuously monitor and update your analysis to adapt to market dynamics. Regularly backtest your strategies to refine and improve your trading decisions.\n",
      "What is the best time to trade VOO?\n",

This is when the market is most liquid and volatility is higher, providing traders with better opportunities for executing trades at desired prices. It is advisable to avoid trading during pre-market or after-hours sessions as liquidity and price stability may be reduced. Additionally, keeping an eye on major economic releases or corporate news during trading hours can help make more informed decisions.\n",
      "What is the 1% trading strategy?\n",
      "The 1% trading strategy, also known as the 1% rule, is a risk management technique used by traders and investors. It suggests that one should never risk more than 1% of their total trading capital on any single trade. This strategy aims to limit potential losses and preserve capital. By adhering to this rule, traders can protect themselves from significant drawdowns and allow for better risk-reward ratios. Ultimately, the 1% trading strategy promotes disciplined and responsible trading practices.\n",
      "What's the most popular trading strategy?\n",
      "The most popular trading strategy is difficult to pinpoint as it varies depending on the individual's goals and risk tolerance. However, some commonly utilized strategies include trend following, mean reversion, and breakout trading. Trend following involves identifying and riding market trends, while mean reversion seeks to profit from the reversion of asset prices to their average value. Breakout trading focuses on identifying price levels where an asset is expected to surge or decline sharply. Ultimately, the choice of strategy depends on the trader's preference, experience, and the prevailing market conditions.\n",

About Barchart | Affiliate Program | Terms of Service | Privacy Policy | Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information | Cookie Settings Trading Strategies Click here for more information on Barchart Opinion and Trading Signals. The Trading Strategies page shows hypothetical trading results from each of the 13 technical indicators analyzed through the Barchart Opinions. Using this page, you can see hypothetical profit or loss that would have resulted following the Buy/Sell signals given by the Opinions. Each of the 13 indicators are back-tested for a period of five years, and the results are summarized for each indicator showing the total number of hypothetical trades, average days per trade and total profit or loss from the trades. The performance results of ALL the indicators are then summarized at the bottom of the page, to give you an Average Performance Summary of how the Opinions would have done over the past five years. Each of the indicators link to a page that shows the breakdown of hypothetical trades that the indicator suggested based on the Barchart Opinion. To view this information, click on any of the indicator names. Barchart Opinions Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. Each Opinion requires more than 200 active trading days to run the prices through 13 different technical indicators; for futures, the contract must have more than 100 trading days. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell or Hold value for the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. The Short, Medium and Long term indicators are grouped together and calculated separately for their groups. The Performance Summary is a composite of all 13 studies listed on the page. Opinions are updated every 20 minutes throughout the day, using delayed data from the exchanges.  Barchart Symbol Notes Tutorial (8:43) Want to use this as your default charts setting?

      "Ladders, barbells, and swaps are some of the trading strategies you can use for buying and selling bonds.\n",
      "Callable bonds can be redeemed by the issuer before the maturity date, exposing you to interest rate risk.\n",
      "Climbing the ladder, exercising with barbells & more\n",
      "Investing in bonds involves more than just finding the security with the highest yield. Among other things, there are strategies that minimize risk, enhance liquidity, and offer diversification.\n",
      "Here's a list of the commonly used strategies, how they work, and their advantages and disadvantages.\n",
      " Bond\n",
      "A debt security (IOU) issued by a corporation, government, or government agency in exchange for the money the bondholder lends it. In most instances, the issuer agrees to pay back the loan by a specific date and make regular interest payments until that date.\n",
      " Yield\n",
      "The income return on an investment usually expressed as a percentage of the investment's cost, current market value, or face value.\n",
      " Risk\n",
      "The potential to lose money (principal and any earnings) or not to make money on an investment.\n",
      " Liquidity\n",
      "The degree of a security's marketability; that is, how quickly the security can be sold at a fair price and converted to cash.\n",
      " Diversification\n",
      "The strategy of investing in different asset classes and among the securities of many issuers in an attempt to lower overall investment risk.\n",
      " Maturity\n",
      "The date when the issuer of a money market instrument or bond agrees to repay the principal, or face value, to the buyer.\n",
      "Interest rate risk\n",
      "The possibility that a security will decline in value because of an increase in interest rates.\n",
      " Reinvestment risk\n",
      "The possibility that reinvested dividends or interest from a particular investment will earn less than the original investment because of falling rates.\n",
      " Principal\n",
      "The amount of money originally put into an investment.\n",
      "Interest/Interest rate\n",
      "Income you can receive by investing in bonds or cash investments. The investment's interest rate is specified when it's issued.\n",
      " Return\n",
      "The gain or loss on an investment. A positive return indicates a gain, and a negative return indicates a loss.\n",
      "Callable security\n",
      "A security that allows the issuer to repurchase or redeem it prior to its maturity date.\n",
      " Long-term bond\n",
      "A bond with a maturity ranging from 10 to 30 years.\n",
      " Short-term bond\n",
      "A bond with a maturity of less than 1 year.\n",
      " Intermediate-term bond\n",
      "A bond with a maturity of 1 to 10 years.\n",
      " Credit quality\n",
      "A measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner.\n",
      " Trade date\n",
      "The actual date on which shares are purchased or sold.\n",
      " Settlement date\n",
      "The date by which a broker must receive either cash or securities to satisfy the terms of a security transaction.\n",
      "Capital gain/loss\n",
      "The difference between the sale price of an asset (such as a mutual fund, stock, or bond) and the original cost of the asset. A capital gain/loss is \"unrealized\" until the investment is sold, when it becomes a realized gain/loss. Realized gains are taxable and they may be considered short-term (if the investment was owned one year or less) or long-term (if the investment was owned for more than one year).\n",
      "Bond ladder\n",
      "A bond ladder contains bonds of relatively equal amounts with staggered maturities. It allows you to invest at regular intervals, minimizing both interest rate and reinvestment risk.\n",
      "How it works\n",
      "When you consider constructing a bond ladder, picture a real ladder.\n",
      "Each rung of the ladder represents a bond. As each bond matures, you can reinvest the principal at current interest rates.\n",
      "Say your ladder has bonds that mature in 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years. When the first bond matures in 2 years, you reinvest the money in a bond with a 10-year maturity, maintaining the ladder you've constructed.\n",
      "The advantages\n",
      "Takes the guesswork out of interest rate swings.\n",
      "Offers a consistent interest revenue stream.\n",
      "Provides ongoing turnover and the opportunity to invest again.\n",
      "Offers diversification of maturities and returns.\n",
      "Can potentially lower expenses.\n",
      "The disadvantages\n",
      "Is a conservative strategy that doesn't maximize your returns.\n",
      "May not be the best strategy for anyone with small amounts of money to invest (usually below $50,000 per issue, considering expenses).\n",
      "May lead to bonds being called if maturities are longer than 10 years. (Understand the call features of any fixed-income security you buy.)\n",
      "Barbell\n",
      "A barbell is a bond portfolio whose assets are mostly in short- and long-term bonds with few, if any, intermediate-term bonds.\n",
      "How it works\n",
      "This time, picture a barbell. Your heavy concentrations of investments comprise the ends of the barbell, with lesser amounts, if any, in the middle.\n",
      "Since this strategy includes a lot of short-term bonds, you'll need to continually trade maturing bonds for new ones.\n",
      "The advantages\n",
      "Captures high yields from longer maturities and uses lower maturities to help minimize interest rate risk.\n",
      "Offers diversification.\n",
      "Provides liquidity and flexibility to handle emergencies.\n",
      "The disadvantages\n",
      "Tends to shortchange a middle-of-the-road strategy by minimizing exposure to intermediate-term bonds.\n",
      "Requires consistent monitoring of short-term investments to replace those that are maturing.\n",
      "Is vulnerable to loss of principal on the long-term investments when interest rates rise.\n",
      "Bond swap\n",
      "A bond swap is simply selling one bond and immediately using the proceeds to buy another.\n",
      "How it works\n",
      "You decide to sell a bond at a loss and use the proceeds to buy a better-performing bond. You can write off the losses on the sale but potentially get a better return on the purchase.\n",
      "The advantages\n",
      "Can reduce your tax liability.\n",
      "May get you a higher rate of return.\n",
      "Offers portfolio diversification.\n",
      "Allows you to act in anticipation of interest rate changes.\n",
      "Can improve the credit quality of your portfolio.\n",
      "The disadvantages\n",
      "Wash sales\n",
      "Your swap could create a \"wash sale\" if you're not careful. That is, the IRS won't recognize any tax loss generated if you sell and repurchase the same or a substantially identical investment within 30 days before or after the trade or settlement date.\n",
      "Tax implications\n",
      "You'll need to understand the differences in the tax treatment of short-term capital gains and losses and long-term capital gains and losses. These differences can affect how you apply the losses and your tax rate on the profits.\n",
      "GOOD TO KNOW!\n",
      " Want an idea of the income you'd receive on a hypothetical investment? Or how much you'd need to invest to get a potential income? Our investment income calculator can estimate the yield, potential income, or amount for a hypothetical investment.\n",
      "Use the investment income calculator\n",
      "Your bond's been called. Now what?\n",
      "If you invested in a bond with a high interest rate—and a \"call feature\"—you might not enjoy that rate until the bond matures. That's because the bond issuer could choose to pay back your principal before the stated maturity date.\n",
      "The risk of callable bonds\n",
      "What's good for you isn't necessarily good for the bond issuer.\n",
      "When interest rates fall, the issuer is likely to want to refinance the debt at a lower rate and call the bond.\n",
      "Meanwhile, you're very happy with the higher rate that callable bonds customarily pay. Now you have to reinvest the money in an interest rate environment that doesn't pay as much.\n",
      "How to protect your investment\n",
      "Protecting your investment starts before you buy a bond:\n",
      "Know if your bond is callable.\n",
      "Find out if it has call protection—a time frame during which the bond can't be called, assuring you'll receive the interest rate for at least that period regardless of what's going on in the markets.\n",
      "Try to find bonds that are non-callable and compare their yields to callable bonds.\n",
      "If you have a callable bond, keep up with interest rates and have a plan to invest the proceeds if the bond is called.\n",
      " Saving for retirement or college?\n",
      "Get help with making a plan, creating a strategy, and selecting the right investments for your needs.\n",
      "Start with your investing goals\n",
      " Already know what you want?\n",
      "From mutual funds and ETFs to stocks and bonds, find all the investments you're looking for, all in one place.\n",
      "Find investment products\n",
      "Explore professional advice\n",
      "We offer expert help at the low cost you'd expect from Vanguard.\n",
      "Compare advice options\n",
      "Open or transfer accounts\n",
      "Get started\n",
      "For more information about Vanguard mutual funds and ETFs, visit Vanguard mutual fund prospectuses or Vanguard ETF prospectuses to obtain a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus. Investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other important information are contained in the prospectus; read and consider it carefully before investing.\n",
      "Investments in bonds are subject to interest rate risk, which is the chance bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates; credit risk, which is the chance a bond issuer will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline; and inflation risk, which is the possibility that increases in the cost of living will reduce or eliminate the returns on a particular investment.\n",
      "All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.\n",
      "Vanguard's advice services are provided by Vanguard Advisers, Inc. (\"VAI\"), a registered investment advisor, or by Vanguard National Trust Company (\"VNTC\"), a federally chartered, limited-purpose trust company.\n",
      "The services provided to clients will vary based upon the service selected, including management, fees, eligibility, and access to an advisor. Find VAI's Form CRS and each program's advisory brochure here for an overview.\n",
      "VAI and VNTC are subsidiaries of The Vanguard Group, Inc., and affiliates of Vanguard Marketing Corporation. Neither VAI, VNTC, nor its affiliates guarantee profits or protection from losses.\n",

About Barchart | Affiliate Program | Terms of Service | Privacy Policy | Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information | Cookie Settings Trading Strategies Click here for more information on Barchart Opinion and Trading Signals. The Trading Strategies page shows hypothetical trading results from each of the 13 technical indicators analyzed through the Barchart Opinions. Using this page, you can see hypothetical profit or loss that would have resulted following the Buy/Sell signals given by the Opinions. Each of the 13 indicators are back-tested for a period of five years, and the results are summarized for each indicator showing the total number of hypothetical trades, average days per trade and total profit or loss from the trades. The performance results of ALL the indicators are then summarized at the bottom of the page, to give you an Average Performance Summary of how the Opinions would have done over the past five years. Each of the indicators link to a page that shows the breakdown of hypothetical trades that the indicator suggested based on the Barchart Opinion. To view this information, click on any of the indicator names. Barchart Opinions Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. Each Opinion requires more than 200 active trading days to run the prices through 13 different technical indicators; for futures, the contract must have more than 100 trading days. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell or Hold value for the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. The Short, Medium and Long term indicators are grouped together and calculated separately for their groups. The Performance Summary is a composite of all 13 studies listed on the page. Opinions are updated every 20 minutes throughout the day, using delayed data from the exchanges.  Barchart Symbol Notes Tutorial (8:43) Want to use this as your default charts setting?

      "The covered call strategy can be used as a reasonable hedge for lower volatility securities. The hedge exists as the premium that is received to lower the cost basis / break-even point of your holdings... but you are only hedged by that amount. It is a great means to generate income on your holdings and act as a 2nd dividend or 2nd income on the shares in your account. \n",
      "Regarding the Money on the Table Report... The sell-to-open call enters you into an obligation to potentially deliver your shares of stock at the sold call strike price. If you wanted to hold the position long term and not worry about rolling or adjusting the call too often, you would likely just stay with Out of the Money (above the current underlying price) looking for a lower probability of assignment. This would mean a lower premium and thus a lower hedge. \n",
      "The Conservative approach means you would be selling a call In the Money to begin with, below the current price. This gives a higher premium due to the intrinsic value and time value of the option premium. However, if you do not want to have your shares assigned you would need to roll the call up to a higher strike price and further out in time. This might cost a higher premium than you initially received. \n",
      "The covered call strategy is a popular and potentially valuable instrument for shares of stock that you own. Note: The most efficient hedge against an optionable stock or ETF in your account is the Married Put strategy.\n",

      "How to use technical analysis indicators for VOO algorithmic trading?\n",
      "To use technical analysis indicators for VOO algorithmic trading, consider using popular indicators like moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and MACD to identify trends, overbought or oversold conditions, and potential entry or exit points.

It is crucial to regularly monitor and adjust the algorithm's performance to adapt to changing market conditions.\n",
      "Can you use artificial intelligence for VOO algorithmic trading?\n",
      "Yes, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for VOO algorithmic trading. VOO, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 index, can benefit from AI algorithms that leverage machine learning techniques to analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.

By harnessing AI, VOO algorithmic trading can be enhanced with faster decision-making, increased efficiency, and improved risk management, potentially leading to better returns for investors.\n",
      "Are there any risks associated with algorithmic trading?\n",
      "Yes, there are risks associated with algorithmic trading. One major risk is the potential for technical glitches or software failures, which can result in substantial financial losses. Additionally, algorithms can be vulnerable to market conditions that were not considered during their design, leading to unexpected and unfavorable outcomes. There is also the risk of over-reliance on algorithms, which can amplify market volatility and create a cascade of trades. Finally, unethical use of algorithms can lead to market manipulation, insider trading, or unfair advantages for certain market participants. Overall, careful monitoring and risk management are essential to mitigate these risks in algorithmic trading.\n",
      "What is algorithmic trading in the context of alternative data?\n",
      "Algorithmic trading in the context of alternative data refers to the use of computer algorithms and advanced data analytics to make trading decisions based on non-traditional sources of information. Alternative data includes a wide range of data points, such as satellite imagery, social media sentiment analysis, and web scraping, which are used to gain insights into market trends and investment opportunities. By leveraging these alternative data sources, algorithmic trading systems can identify patterns and generate trading strategies with greater speed and accuracy, ultimately enabling traders to make more informed and profitable decisions.\n",

      "Considerations for ETF trading strategies\n",
      " December 07, 2023\n",
      "The more popular ETFs become, the more important it is that investors use the right trading strategies. That’s particularly true of large trades, which have the potential to move an ETF’s price. Large trades can be quite complex and, if mishandled, can create negative consequences for an investor’s portfolio.\n",
      "For example, Vanguard’s ETF Capital Markets Desk gets a lot of calls from advisors about large trade orders to rebalance client portfolios. Rebalancing trades may recur—say, quarterly—or they may be used strategically when markets are volatile. Advisors often ask how they can minimize transaction costs as they rebalance clients’ ETF portfolios to achieve their targeted allocations.\n",
      "As investors continue to shift to ETFs, larger block trades are hitting the market more frequently.1 This means that getting the trading piece right is more important than ever.\n",
      "Industry mutual fund and ETF assets and net cash flows, 2013–2023\n",
      "Notes: Mutual fund and ETF assets under management data are as of August 31, 2023. Ten-year net flows data cover August 31, 2013, through August 31, 2023.\n",
      "Sources: Vanguard, based on data from Morningstar, Inc.\n",
      "The right tool for the job\n",
      "Just as carpenters have unique tools in their toolbox for specific jobs, investors have different trading strategies at their disposal for different types of transactions. It’s important to choose the tools that will most help you execute your ETF order and incur the lowest transaction costs possible.\n",
      "Crucially, big and small ETF trades are not necessarily handled the same way. Smaller ETF trades typically use “low-touch” orders, which can be self-provisioned by executing either limit orders or market orders. Larger ETF block trades generally take a “high-touch” approach.2 High-touch trades may require working with a custodian’s block trading desk to execute the ETF order with greater discretion.\n",
      "Common low-touch ETF order types\n",
      "Market order: An order to buy or sell a security immediately at the best available current price. The priorities for this type of order are speed and execution, not price. These are popular among individual investors who want to buy or sell ETFs without delay. The primary risk associated with this order type is the impact on price.\n",
      "Limit order: An order to buy a security at no more than—or sell a security at no less than—a specified price. This gives the investor some control over the price at which the trade is executed and can safeguard against unexpected market volatility.\n",
      "Marketable limit order: A limit order that is placed for immediate execution. For a marketable buy limit order, the limit price is set at or above the ask price—the price at which the security is offered for sale. For a marketable sell limit order, the limit price is set at or below the bid—the price a prospective buyer is willing to pay.\n",
      "Common high-touch ETF order types\n",
      "Risk trade: A trade at a negotiated price for a block of ETF shares, in which the market maker—a dealer firm that maintains specified bid and ask prices and can buy or sell at publicly quoted prices—commits capital to facilitate the investor’s order immediately. Generally, risk trades occur at a slight premium or discount to the quoted spread or national best bid and offer (NBBO) at the time of the trade.\n",
      "Algorithmic trades (algos): Trading strategies that use automated algorithms to try to achieve specific execution outcomes. Algo trades are generally executed over time and are intended to minimize price impact in the market. Three common algo strategies are:\n",
      "VWAP trade—Volume-weighted average price, based on a security’s average trading price throughout the day and accounting for trade volume.\n",
      "TWAP trade—Time-weighted average price, based on average trading price for evenly divided time slots to try to minimize market impact.\n",
      "POV trade—Percent of volume, using partial orders based on a user-defined participation ratio and market volume.        \n",
      "Check the ETF’s liquidity profile\n",
      "Deciding whether to use low-touch or high-touch orders depends on how big the investor’s planned trade is compared with the ETF’s liquidity profile, or how easily the ETF’s shares can be quickly bought or sold at a price reflecting its intrinsic value. If the trade amount exceeds 5% of the ETF’s average daily volume (ADV), a few other considerations are important before submitting an order. An investor with experience submitting low-touch market orders in this scenario may wish to consider marketable limit orders instead. These are limit orders priced for immediate execution.3\n",
      "Anyone considering a marketable limit order for a relatively large trade should understand whether enough shares are available in the secondary market to readily absorb the trade. For sellers, the offer should not greatly exceed the shares on the bid; for buyers, the request should not greatly outnumber the shares on the offer. Too large an order could show too much information to the market, which could work against execution quality.\n",
      "It may still be possible, though, to execute a low-touch trade that is much larger than the quoted size in the secondary market. This would be in the form of a not held limit order. Such orders allow investors to stipulate the price at which they’re willing to execute the trade and protect against unintentional price impact, while not revealing the full size of the trade to the market. If bids or offers don’t materialize at the desired price, the trade won’t happen, thus avoiding any unexpected ETF executions.\n",
      "Big trades often require high-touch orders\n",
      "The adjacent decision tree can help an investor determine whether a high-touch or low-touch order is most suitable. If the trade size exceeds both 5% of ADV and the quoted size available on the bid/offer, the investor may also need to consider whether the order is large enough to result in the creation or redemption of ETF shares.4\n",
      "ETF trading decision tree\n",
      "Source: Vanguard.\n",
      "The power of order aggregation\n",
      "Vanguard occasionally sees a trading style applied to ETFs that has traditionally been used for mutual fund portfolios—submitting batch orders all at once at the same time each day.5 Although this works for mutual funds priced once a day at the fund’s net asset value (NAV), it may not be the best solution for ETFs. Rebalancing numerous portfolios and submitting countless low-touch trades for a single ETF at the same time runs the risk of affecting the ETF’s price and resulting in higher transaction costs for the end investor.\n",
      "One useful trading technique that can make rebalancing ETF portfolios across numerous investor accounts more efficient is order aggregation—the simple concept of taking numerous orders on the same ETF and the same side of the market and aggregating them into a single trade.\n",
      "Not only does this minimize the operational challenges of submitting multiple trades across various investor accounts, but it also provides more trade flexibility in using high-touch orders to help achieve the best execution.\n",
      "Takeaways\n",
      "The great benefit of intraday trading should be balanced with the right trading strategy.\n",
      "As the use of ETFs increases and larger trades become more frequent, investors have an opportunity to perfect how they approach big trades such as rebalancing trades. Investors who weigh different trade considerations carefully to avoid any surprises and achieve the best execution can potentially increase the chances for optimal outcomes.\n",
      "Using the ETF trading decision tree can help avoid an unexpected ETF execution.\n",
      "1 Definitions of large or block trades can vary. Some exchanges define block trades as any trade over 10,000 shares. Custodian requirements are often tied to the percentage of the average daily trading volume (ADV), share quantity, or dollar value of the trade. For example, any trade representing 5% or more of an ETF’s ADV would be considered a large trade that should involve consultation with a block trading desk.\n",
      "2 Low-touch orders refer to “held orders” that are held to the national best bid and offer (NBBO) price. High-touch orders give your broker time and price discretion to execute the order and aim to achieve the best price available. They are also called “not held” orders, since they are not held to the NBBO.\n",
      "3 Vanguard suggests that investors consider using limit orders or marketable limit orders to avoid any unexpected ETF executions. In Vanguard’s view, marketable limit orders may represent the best of both worlds in that executions are quick and include safeguards that market orders lack.\n",
      "4 ETFs are created and redeemed in unit sizes. Generally, 25,000 ETF shares is the minimum to facilitate a creation or redemption; however, creation unit size can vary by product.\n",

      "Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.\n",
      "All investing is subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of a client's account. There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet a client's investment objectives or provide the client with a given level of income. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.\n",

      "This content from Vanguard provides valuable information regarding ETF trading strategies. The key risks mentioned here are associated with large trades, as these have the potential to move the ETF’s price. Different trading strategies and order types can be used based on the size of the trade, and if handled incorrectly, large trades can have negative consequences for an investor’s portfolio. The content also discusses considerations for trades that exceed 5% of the ETF’s average daily volume (ADV). For such trades, it's suggested to use marketable limit orders and to be aware of the impact on price. High-touch orders are recommended for large trades, and it's also important to consider the ETF’s liquidity profile.\n",
