      " Day trading involves buying and selling financial instruments at least once within the same day. If played correctly, taking advantage of small price moves can be a lucrative game. Yet, it can be dangerous for beginners and anyone else who doesn't have a well-thought-out strategy.\n",
      " Not all brokers are suited for the high volume day trading generates. Meanwhile, some fit perfectly with day traders. Check out our list of the best brokers for day trading that accommodate individuals who would like to day trade.\n",
      " The online brokers on our list, Interactive Brokers and Webull, have professional or advanced versions of their platforms with real-time streaming quotes, charting tools, and the ability to enter and modify complex orders in quick succession.\n",
      " Below, we'll take a look at 10 day trading strategies for beginners. Then, we'll consider when to buy and sell, basic charts and patterns, and how to limit losses.\n",
      "Key Takeaways\n",
      "Day trading is only profitable in the long run when traders take it seriously and do their research.Day traders must be diligent, focused, objective, and unemotional in their work.Interactive Brokers and Webull are two recommended online brokers for day traders.Day traders often look at liquidity, volatility, and volume when deciding what stocks to buy.Some tools that day traders use to pinpoint buying points include candlestick chart patterns, trend lines and triangles, and volume.\n",
      " 1. Knowledge Is Power In addition to knowledge of procedures, day traders need to keep up with the latest stock market news and events that affect stocks. This included the Federal Reserve System's interest rate plans, leading indicator announcements, and other economic, business, and financial news.\n",
      " So, do your homework. Make a wish list of stocks you'd like to trade. Be informed about the selected companies, their stocks, and general markets. Scan business news and bookmark reliable online news outlets.\n",
      " 2. Set Aside Funds Assess and commit to the amount of capital you're willing to risk on each trade. Many successful day traders risk less than 1% to 2% of their accounts per trade. If you have a $40,000 trading account and are willing to risk 0.5% of your capital on each trade, your maximum loss per trade is $200 (0.5% x $40,000). Moreover, only trade with suitable online brokers and trading platforms.\n",
      " Earmark funds you can trade with and are prepared to lose.\n",
      " 3. Set Aside Time Day trading requires your time and attention. In fact, you'll need to give up most of your day. Don’t consider it if you have limited time to spare.\n",
      " Day trading requires a trader to track the markets and spot opportunities that can arise at any time during trading hours. Being aware and moving quickly are key.\n",
      " 4. Start Small As a beginner, focus on a maximum of one to two stocks during a session. Tracking and finding prospects is easier with just a few stocks. It's now common to trade fractional shares. That lets you specify smaller dollar amounts that you wish to invest.\n",
      " This means that if Amazon.com (AMZN) shares are trading at $170, many brokers will now let you buy a fractional share for as low as $5.\n",
      " 5. Avoid Penny Stocks You're probably looking for deals and low prices but stay away from penny stocks. These stocks are often illiquid and the chances of hitting the jackpot with them are often bleak.\n",
      " Many stocks trading under $5 a share become delisted from major stock exchanges and are only tradable over-the-counter (OTC). Unless you see a real opportunity and have done your research, steer clear of these. Finding real undervalued stocks can be demanding.\n",
      " 6. Time Those Trades Many orders placed by investors and traders begin to execute as soon as the markets open in the morning, contributing to price volatility. A seasoned player may be able to recognize patterns at the open and time orders to make profits. For beginners, it may be better to read the market without making any moves for the first 15 to 20 minutes.\n",
      " The middle hours are usually less volatile. Then, the movement begins to pick up again toward the closing bell. Though rush hours offer opportunities, it’s safer for beginners to avoid them at first.\n",
      " 7. Cut Losses With Limit Orders Decide what type of orders you'll use to enter and exit trades. Will you use market orders or limit orders? A market order is executed at the best price available, with no price guarantee. It's useful when you want to enter or exit the market and don't care about getting filled at a specific price.\n",
      " A limit order guarantees the price but not the execution. Limit orders can help you trade more precisely and confidently because you set the price at which your order should be executed. A limit order can cut your loss on reversals. However, if the market doesn't reach your price, your order won't be filled and you'll maintain your position.\n",
      " More sophisticated and experienced day traders may also employ options strategies to hedge their positions.\n",
      " 8. Be Realistic About Profits A strategy doesn't need to succeed all the time to be profitable. Traders can be successful by only profiting from 50% to 60% of their trades. However, they need to profit more on their winners than they lose on their losers. Ensure the financial risk on each trade is limited to a specific percentage of your account and that entry and exit methods are clearly defined.\n",
      " 9. Reflect on Investment Behavior For day traders, frequent reflection on investment behavior is crucial. It helps them identify patterns, learn from past mistakes, and fine-tune their strategies. This fosters continuous learning and adapting to ever-changing market conditions. In addition, it encourages discipline and emotional control, which are key to successful trading.\n",
      " 10. Stick to the Plan Successful traders have to move fast, but they don't have to think fast. Why? Because they've developed a trading strategy in advance, along with the discipline to stick to it. It is important to follow your formula and methodology closely rather than try to chase profits. Don't let your emotions get the best of you and make you abandon your strategy. Bear in mind a mantra of day traders: plan your trade and trade your plan.\n",
      " Investopedia / Madelyn Goodnight\n",
      " How To Start Day Trading Getting underway in day trading involves putting your financial resources together, setting up with a broker who can handle day trading volume, and engaging in self-education and strategic planning. Here's how to start in five steps:\n",
      " Step 1: Educate yourself. Before you start trading, it's crucial to understand the trading principles and specific strategies used in day trading. Read books, take courses, and study financial markets. The major topic to study is technical analysis, which should include reading up on trading psychology and (this is a must) risk management.\n",
      " Step 2: Develop your trading plan. Outline your investment goals, risk tolerance, and specific trading strategies you've picked up from Step 1. Your plan should specify your entry and exit criteria, how much capital you are willing to risk on each trade, and your overall risk management strategy. Before investing real money, put your plan into practice with a real-time trading simulator. This helps you get familiarized with market behavior and the trading platform without financial risk.\n",
      " Step 3: Choose a trading platform and fund your account. You'll want a reputable broker that caters to day traders and has low transaction fees, quick order execution, and a reliable trading platform. Once you're ready, fund your account. It's advisable to begin with a relatively small amount in your trading account and only put in money you can afford to lose.\n",
      " Step 4: Begin trading with small positions. This reduces the risks of losing all your money on one or a series of bad trades while you're still learning. As you do so, continuously review your trades and check them against your learning resources to adjust your strategy. Day trading requires constantly adapting to changing situations.\n",
      " Step 5: Maintain discipline. Adjusting to changing circumstances does not mean shifting your stop-loss and stop-limit settings or other trading criteria as you take on more risk. Successful day trading relies very much on discipline and emotional control. Stick to your trading plan; don't let emotions drive your decisions. That's the way to quick ruin.\n",
      " What Makes Day Trading Difficult? Day trading takes a lot of practice and know-how, and several factors can make it challenging.\n",
      " First, know that you're competing against professionals whose careers revolve around trading. These people have access to the best technology and connections in the industry, which means they're set up to succeed. Jumping on the bandwagon usually means more profits for them.\n",
      " Next, understand that Uncle Sam will want a cut of your profits, no matter how slim. You'll have to pay taxes on any short-term gains—investments you hold for one year or less—at the marginal rate. The upside is that your losses will offset any gains.\n",
      " Also, as a beginning day trader, you may be prone to emotional and psychological biases that affect your trading—for instance, when your capital is involved and you're losing money on a trade. Experienced, skilled professional traders with deep pockets can usually surmount these challenges.\n",
      "Day Traders Lose\n",
      "An early popularizer of day trading, Toby Crabel, is also credited with a classic day trading strategy, the opening range breakout. Crabel has had some influence on technical analysis, and he often suggested that day traders are social psychologists with a computer program.\n",
      " Deciding What and When to Buy What To Buy Day traders try to make money by exploiting minute price movements in individual assets (stocks, currencies, futures, and options). They usually leverage large amounts of capital to do so. In deciding what to buy—a stock, say—a typical day trader looks for three things:\n",
      "Liquidity. A security with this allows you to buy and sell it easily and, hopefully, at a reasonable price. Liquidity is an advantage with tight spreads, or the difference between the bid and ask price of a stock, and for low slippage, or the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price.\n",
      "Volatility. This measures the daily price range—the range in which a day trader operates. More volatility means greater potential for profit or loss.\n",
      "Trading volume measures the number of times a stock is bought and sold in a given period. It's commonly known as the average daily trading volume. High volume indicates a lot of interest in a stock. An increase in a stock's volume is often a harbinger of a price jump, either up or down.\n",
      " When To Buy Once you know the stocks (or other assets) you want to trade, you need to identify entry points for your trades. Tools that can help you do this include:\n",
      "Real-time news services: News moves stocks, so it's important to subscribe to services that alert you when potentially market-moving news breaks.\n",
      "ECN/Level 2 quotes: Electronic communication networks (ECNs) are computer-based systems that display the best available bid and ask quotes from market participants and then automatically match and execute orders. Level 2 is a subscription-based service that provides real-time access to the Nasdaq order book, which has price quotes from market makers in every Nasdaq-listed and OTC Bulletin Board security. Together, they can give you a sense of orders executed in real-time.\n",
      "Intraday candlestick charts: Candlesticks provide a raw analysis of price action. More on these later.\n",
      " Define and write down the specific conditions under which you'll enter a position. For instance, buying during an uptrend isn't specific enough. Instead, put down something more specific and testable: buy when the price breaks above the upper trendline of a triangle pattern, where the triangle is preceded by an uptrend (at least one higher swing high and higher swing low before the triangle formed) on the two-minute chart in the first two hours of the trading day.\n",
      " Once you have specific entry rules, scan more charts to see if your conditions are generated each day. For instance, determine whether a candlestick chart pattern signals price moves in the direction you anticipate. If so, you have a potential entry point for a strategy.\n",
      " Next, you'll need to determine how to exit your trades.\n",
      " Deciding When To Sell There are several ways to exit a winning position, including trailing stops and profit targets. Profit targets are the most common exit method. They refer to taking a profit at a predetermined price level. Here are some common profit target strategies:\n",
      "Strategy\n",
      "Description\n",
      "Scalping\n",
      "Scalping is one of the most popular strategies. It involves selling almost immediately after a trade becomes profitable. The price target is whatever figure means that you'll make money on the trade.\n",
      "Fading\n",
      "Fading involves shorting stocks after rapid moves upward. This is based on the assumption that (1) they are overbought, (2) early buyers are ready to take profits, and, (3) existing buyers may be scared away. Although risky, this strategy can be extremely rewarding. Here, the price target is when buyers begin stepping in again.\n",
      "Daily Pivots\n",
      "This strategy involves profiting from a stock's daily volatility. You attempt to buy at the low of the day and sell at the high of the day. Here, the price target is simply at the next sign of a reversal.\n",
      "Momentum\n",
      "This strategy usually involves trading on news releases or finding strong trending moves supported by high volume. One type of momentum trader will buy on news releases and ride a trend until it exhibits signs of reversal. Another type will fade the price surge. Here, the price target is when volume begins to decrease.\n",
      " Often, you will want to sell an asset when there is decreased interest in the stock as indicated by the ECN/Level 2 and volume. The profit target should also allow for more money to be made on winning trades than is lost on losing trades. If your stop loss is $0.05 away from your entry price, your target should be more than $0.05 away.\n",
      " Just as with your entry point, define exactly how you will exit your trades before you enter them. The exit criteria must be specific enough to be repeatable and testable.\n",
      " Day Trading Charts and Patterns Here are three common tools day traders use to help them determine opportune buying points:\n",
      " Price charts using depictions such as candlesticks. Also, various chart patterns, including engulfing candles, dojis, and many others.Other technical analysis, including trend lines and various indicators such as the relative strength index, moving average convergence divergence, and many others.Volume\n",
      " There are many candlestick setups a day trader can look for to find an entry point. If followed correctly, the doji reversal pattern (highlighted in yellow in the chart below) is one of the most reliable.\n",
      " Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019\n",
      " Also, look for signs that confirm the pattern:\n",
      "A volume spike on the doji candle or the candles immediately following it, which can indicate that traders are supporting the price at this level\n",
      "Prior support at this price level, such as the prior low of day or high of day Level 2 activity, which will show all the open orders and order sizes\n",
      " If you use these three confirmation steps, you may determine whether the doji is signaling an actual turnaround and a potential entry point.\n",
      " Chart patterns also provide profit targets for exits. For example, the height of a triangle at the widest part is added to the breakout point of the triangle (for an upside breakout), providing a price at which to take profits.\n",
      " How to Limit Losses When Day Trading  Stop-Loss Orders It's important to define exactly how you'll limit your trade risk. A stop-loss order is designed to limit losses on a position in a security. For long positions, a stop-loss can be placed below a recent low and for short positions, above a recent high. It can also be based on volatility.\n",
      " For example, if a stock price is moving about $0.05 a minute, then you might place a stop-loss order $0.15 away from your entry to give the price some space to fluctuate before it moves in your anticipated direction.\n",
      " For a triangle pattern, a stop-loss order can be placed $0.02 below a recent swing low if buying a breakout, or $0.02 below the pattern.\n",
      " You could also set two stop-loss orders:\n",
      " Place an actual stop-loss order at a price level that suits your risk tolerance. This level represents the most money that you can stand to lose.Set a mental stop-loss order at the point where your entry criteria would be violated. If the trade takes an unexpected turn, you'll immediately exit your position.\n",
      " However you decide to exit your trades, the exit criteria must be specific enough to be testable and repeatable.\n",
      " Set a Financial Loss Limit It's smart to set a maximum loss per day that you can afford. Whenever you hit this point, exit your trade and take the rest of the day off. Stick to your plan. After all, tomorrow is another (trading) day.\n",
      " Test Your Strategy You've defined how you enter trades and where you'll place a stop-loss order. Now, you can assess whether the potential strategy fits within your risk limit. If the strategy exposes you to too much risk, you need to alter it in some way to reduce the risk.\n",
      " If the strategy is within your risk limit, then testing begins. Manually go through historical charts to find entry points that match yours. Note whether your stop-loss order or price target would have been hit. Paper trade in this way for at least 50 to 100 trades. Determine whether the strategy would have been profitable and if the results meet your expectations.\n",
      " If your strategy works, proceed to trading in a demo account in real time. If you take profits over the course of two months or more in a simulated environment, proceed with day trading with real capital. If the strategy isn't profitable, start over.\n",
      " Finally, keep in mind that if you trade on margin, you can be far more vulnerable to sudden price movements. Trading on margin means borrowing your investment funds from a brokerage firm. It requires you to add funds to your account at the end of the day if your trade goes against you. Therefore, using stop-loss orders is crucial when day trading on margin.\n",
      " Day Trading Strategies for Beginners Now that you know some of the ins and outs of day trading, let's review some of the key techniques new day traders can use.\n",
      " When you've mastered these techniques, developed your own trading styles, and determined your end goals, you can use a series of strategies to help you in your quest for profits.\n",
      " Although some of these techniques were mentioned above, they are worth going into again:\n",
      " Following the trend: Anyone who follows the trend will buy when prices are rising or short sell when they drop. This is done on the assumption that prices that have been rising or falling steadily will continue to do so.Contrarian investing: This strategy assumes a rise in prices will reverse and drop. The contrarian buys during a fall or short sells during a rise, with the express expectation that the trend will change.Scalping: This is a style by which a speculator exploits small price gaps created by the bid-ask spread. This technique normally involves entering and exiting a position quickly—within minutes or even seconds.Trading the news: Investors using this strategy will buy when good news is announced or short sell when there's bad news. This can lead to greater volatility, which can lead to higher profits or losses.\n",
      " Why Is It Difficult to Make Money Consistently From Day Trading?\n",
      "Doing so requires combining many skills and attributes—knowledge, experience, discipline, mental fortitude, and trading acumen.It's not always easy for beginners to carry out basic strategies like cutting losses or letting profits run. What's more, it's difficult to stick to one's trading discipline in the face of challenges such as market volatility or significant losses.Finally, day trading means going against millions of market participants, including trading pros who have access to cutting-edge technology, a wealth of experience and expertise, and very deep pockets. That's no easy task when everyone is trying to exploit inefficiencies in the markets.\n",
      " Should a Day Trading Position Be Held Overnight?\n",
      "A day trader may wish to hold a trading position overnight either to reduce losses on a poor trade or to increase profits on a winning trade. Generally, this is not a good idea if the trader simply wants to avoid booking a loss on a bad trade.Risks involved in holding a day trading position overnight may include having to meet margin requirements, additional borrowing costs, and the potential impact of negative news. The risk involved in holding a position overnight could outweigh the possibility of a favorable outcome.\n",
      " How Much do Day Traders Make?\n",
      "Day traders' earnings vary widely based on experience, skill level, trading strategy, and market conditions. Some may earn a substantial income, while others may not be as successful. It's important to note that day trading involves significant risk and is not suitable for everyone.\n",
      " Is Day Trading Worth it?\n",
      "This largely depends on individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and expertise. While it can offer significant profits and flexibility for some, it's high-risk, time-consuming, and not suitable for everyone. It's estimated that a majority of day traders don't profit, indicating the need for careful consideration and preparation.\n",
      " How Much Money Do I Need To Start Day Trading Stocks?\n",
      "The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's (FINRA) pattern day trader rule requires a $25,000 minimum balance if you want to make four or more day trades within a five-business day span. Beyond that, consider transaction costs (commissions, fees) that will eat into your profits and the need for a financial cushion to handle potential losses—the FINRA rule is meant to be a minimum. It's prudent to have significantly more capital to trade effectively and, frankly, reduce the psychological pressure of trading with money you can't afford to lose. Day trading is highly risky, and most individual traders don't achieve success. It should be approached with the understanding that it takes significant skill and a high tolerance for risk. Day trading is not the path to quick or easy profits.\n",
      " The Bottom Line Day trading is difficult to master. It requires time, skill, and discipline. Many who try it lose money, but the strategies and techniques described above may help you create a potentially profitable strategy.\n",
      " Day traders, both institutional and individual, play an important role in the marketplace by keeping the markets efficient and liquid. With enough experience, skill-building, and consistent performance evaluation, you may be able to beat the odds and improve your chances of trading profitably.\n",

      " Home Learn Trading guides News trading Trading the newsMany short-term traders base their decisions solely on technical analysis and price charts, regardless of which markets they are trading. It's common for traders to completely ignore fundamental factors and instead follow price trends, analyse support and resistance levels and weigh up various signals from technical indicators.However, fundamental analysis​​ is just as important in the modern trading world as technical analysis. News releases such as earnings reports and changes to interest rates and inflation can significantly impact the markets. Trading on news releases can, therefore, prove vastly beneficial to traders and can significantly strengthen their trading strategy by adding economic announcements to their purely technical and charting approach. Learn how to trade the news and spot potential trading opportunities within the financial markets.See inside our platformGet tight spreads, no hidden fees and access to 10,000+ instruments.Start tradingIncludes free demo accountTrustpilotQuick link to content:How to read news for tradingIn order to read news events, you should familiarise yourself with economic indicators​​, which are macroeconomic factors that have an impact on all financial markets, whether it be forex, shares or indices. These can include changes to interest rates, inflation, unemployment levels or retail income for a specific country and these all have a significant effect on the financial markets and overall state of the economy.Economic announcements often involve these particular factors when advising traders of recent changes within the markets. This can have an impact on market sentiment​​, especially if the data announcement is not in line with what the traders had been expecting.News trading strategyA news trading strategy involves trading based on market expectations, both before and after a news release. Trading on news announcements can require you to make quick decisions, as the financial markets may be impacted almost immediately. Therefore, you will need to make quick judgements on how to trade the announcement.When trading on news releases, it is important that you are aware of how financial markets work. Sometimes news is already factored into the assets price. This happens because traders attempt to predict the results of future news announcements and so, in turn, the market responds by changing the price of an asset. News-based trading is especially useful for volatile markets, for example oil trading.Read more about using fundamental analysis in the consideration of external factors as part of your news trading strategy.How to trade the newsRegister for an account with CMC Markets.

Our guide to the most common trading strategies involves long-term fundamental strategies and short-term price action strategies.Look at combining fundamental and technical practises. These two types of analysis may be more effective when used together, rather than solely relying on one for all trading decisions.Trade the news in forexAs with other asset classes, forex trading news can become particularly active before and following major economic events. However, there are significant differences between the type of news that sets apart currencies from other financial markets.Forex markets tend to respond the most to macroeconomic news – the kind of developments that reflect or impact broad economies. Generally speaking, forex traders can look at economic news to assess its impact on interest rates and monetary policy​. News that suggests a more hawkish (aggressive) central bank tends to push forex pairs up in value relative to other currencies, while dovish (peaceful) news can cause a currency to depreciate.Currencies of countries that are major exporters of raw materials or commodities can be impacted by news forex trading news, as this affects the prices of the main commodities that they produce. These currencies are often referred to as resource currencies. Prices of commodities that affect these currencies can be influenced by issues affecting supply and demand.On the supply side, news that suggests a lower supply can push up prices, while news that suggests higher supply can depress prices, which can then impact related currencies. News that could reflect changes in supply may cover political tensions, wars, terrorism, weather, economic sanctions, labour relations (strikes) and more. Speculation and pricing related to demand is mainly influenced by many of the same major news releases noted above, plus commodity inventory reports and outlooks.Forex news trading strategyIn order to come up with a comprehensive forex trading strategy using news releases, forex traders tend to look out for certain key forex indicators that can have an impact on interest-rate speculation, including:Central bank decisions and speechesInflation ratesGross domestic product (GDP) figuresEmployment figuresTrade balancesNews related to market sentiment can also influence currency trading, particularly those considered to be safe havens, including the commodity gold, as well as major currencies USD, JPY and CHF. These currencies tend to attract capital during times of turmoil and see outflows when the financial markets settle down.News that can impact risk-on, risk-off trading includes stock market returns and volatility, financial stresses at the national or continental level, political turmoil, elections, treaty negotiations and other broad news beyond economic data and central banks. Recent examples include the Greek debt crisis and China market turmoil.Trade the news via Morningstar and ReutersStart with a live accountPractise with a demoForex news trading predictionsTraders should be aware that demand for many commodities – and therefore the commodity's price – rises and falls with the seasons. Seasonal forex trading news and impacts tend to be seen in energy and agricultural commodities, but less so for precious metals. The table below shows some of the main resource currencies and the commodities that affect them. These can be used by traders as a sort of forex news trading signal, as it can help to predict where the price of the currency is headed.CountryCurrency pairCommodity productCanadaUSD/CADWTI crude oil and metalsAustraliaAUD/USDBase metals and grainsNew ZealandNZD/USDLivestock and dairyNorwayUSD/NOKCrude oilsSwedenUSD/SEKMetals and forest productsSouth AfricaUSD/ZARPrecious metalsRussiaUSD/RUBCrude oil, natural gas and metalsHow to use news to trade stocksStock trading based on news releases is a strategy used by many long-term investors, as well as short-term traders. If a company has strong balance sheets, cash flows and earnings reports consistently, then a trader may decide to buy and hold the share for a longer period of time.However, if a company releases a report with considerably lower financials than expected, this can cause a rally for traders to short the stock as its value is decreasing. Traders can perform company analysis before deciding whether to invest in a stock. This includes analysing its growth rate potential, as well as any potential legal, political or insolvency risks. Financial ratios such as price/earnings along with dividend yields can also indicate whether a stock is a healthy investment right now.Our Morningstar equity research reports are updated regularly with new information about company fundamentals. These are available for a wide range of shares on our platform and can also indicate whether they are considered to be overvalued, fairly valued or undervalued within the stock market. This information may help traders to make a decision on whether to enter a position or not. Register for a live account now to access our Morningstar reports.In general, news that has a significant impact on individual company shares may not have a major impact on currencies. Stock market news that has little or no impact on currencies includes earnings reports, management changes, mergers and acquisitions and partnerships. Therefore, it may be easier for some to make more reliable forex news trading predictions on how the market will perform.News trading signalsSome brokers offer automated news trading signals that can help a trader to make decisions on whether to enter, exit or avoid a trade. These hints are based on price fluctuations after a certain type of news release and can prompt traders to either buy or sell an asset.A manual alternative is to monitor upcoming tradeable events using our economic calendar. This feature can be found on our Next Generation platform and highlights events such as unemployment reports, GDP, CPI and PPI figures, as well as trade reports and sentiment surveys. These events can all have an effect on market sentiment and cause major price swings within the financial markets.Our market calendar can be customised by date, market impact (low to high) and country, so you can filter these to be more relevant for the asset or market that you are interested in trading. You can also set alerts for individual events that you wish to monitor.Trading news releases: what are the benefits?It can help to increase volatilityCertain major economic announcements can bring additional volatility in the markets, even if it is for just a short period of time. Even the neatest forex or stock chart patterns can temporarily be thrown out of sync by a significant trading announcement, such as the latest unemployment news or changes to interest rates or inflation from a nationwide bank.Paying attention to when trading announcements are due can mean that you end up placing a carefully planned trade just before a major event happens, which instantly triggers your stop-loss. It may be more opportune to wait to open new positions after news events have taken place, and then see if the reason for the trade is still valid.It can trigger unexpected market reactionsThere is normally a consensus amongst leading economists about what level an economic announcement is likely to come in at. Changes to non-farm payrolls​​, GDP or inflation data will have a resulting effect on the market. For example, low unemployment suggests a strong economy, so many would expect the stock market to rise. A decision to lower interest rates could make a country’s currency less attractive, causing it to fall against other world currencies.From time to time, however, economic announcements are very different from what the broader market was expecting, and this can cause an opposite market reaction. For example, if a central bank hints that rate cuts may be coming, but the currency still rises, there could be other factors in addition to the prospect of interest rate changes. This could, in turn, prove to be a strong 'buy' signal. If the currency does not drop on an expectation of a fall in interest rates, then positive sentiment is strong, and this could possibly indicate that it is now a buyer’s market.It can indicate that trends are changingMany traders try to identify trends in the hope of profit. Such trends could range across minutes, days or even months. But most trends reverse at some point, and a change in the underlying economics could be the first sign of this.Every journey starts with a single step and this is true of trend reversals as well. An economic announcement is rarely enough to quickly change a medium-term trend, but how the market reacts to surprises can give the first clue that sentiment is starting to shift. This offers traders an opportunity to open positions at the very start of a new trend.Practise trading news on the goSeamlessly open and close trades, track your progress and set up alertsOpen a demo accountLearn moreRisks of news tradingOf course, there are drawbacks of news-based trading as well. In particular, news trading requires expert fundamental analysis skills, as you will need to understand how certain economic announcements can affect your positions and the wider financial market.There is also the risk of carrying positions for a longer period of time. If the news release requires a few days or weeks to materialise, your trading positions may be open over several days. This brings overnight risk and may require you to pay additional holding costs. Therefore, traders should ensure that they have sufficient funds in their account to cover these costs.How to get started trading market newsOpen an account with CMC Markets to access our multitude of news and analysis tools.

It's possible that MMC is an acronym for a specific trading strategy or an indicator such as Money Management Correlation. It might also be a specific company like Marsh & Mclennan. Without the specific context, it's difficult to provide an accurate strategy. Given this ambiguity, I'll provide a general strategy for news trading that can be adapted to various scenarios. \n",

      " Home Learn Trading guides News trading Trading the newsMany short-term traders base their decisions solely on technical analysis and price charts, regardless of which markets they are trading. It's common for traders to completely ignore fundamental factors and instead follow price trends, analyse support and resistance levels and weigh up various signals from technical indicators.However, fundamental analysis​​ is just as important in the modern trading world as technical analysis. News releases such as earnings reports and changes to interest rates and inflation can significantly impact the markets. Trading on news releases can, therefore, prove vastly beneficial to traders and can significantly strengthen their trading strategy by adding economic announcements to their purely technical and charting approach. Learn how to trade the news and spot potential trading opportunities within the financial markets.See inside our platformGet tight spreads, no hidden fees and access to 10,000+ instruments.Start tradingIncludes free demo accountTrustpilotQuick link to content:How to read news for tradingIn order to read news events, you should familiarise yourself with economic indicators​​, which are macroeconomic factors that have an impact on all financial markets, whether it be forex, shares or indices. These can include changes to interest rates, inflation, unemployment levels or retail income for a specific country and these all have a significant effect on the financial markets and overall state of the economy.Economic announcements often involve these particular factors when advising traders of recent changes within the markets. This can have an impact on market sentiment​​, especially if the data announcement is not in line with what the traders had been expecting.News trading strategyA news trading strategy involves trading based on market expectations, both before and after a news release. Trading on news announcements can require you to make quick decisions, as the financial markets may be impacted almost immediately. Therefore, you will need to make quick judgements on how to trade the announcement.When trading on news releases, it is important that you are aware of how financial markets work. Sometimes news is already factored into the assets price. This happens because traders attempt to predict the results of future news announcements and so, in turn, the market responds by changing the price of an asset. News-based trading is especially useful for volatile markets, for example oil trading.Read more about using fundamental analysis in the consideration of external factors as part of your news trading strategy.How to trade the newsRegister for an account with CMC Markets.

Our guide to the most common trading strategies involves long-term fundamental strategies and short-term price action strategies.Look at combining fundamental and technical practises. These two types of analysis may be more effective when used together, rather than solely relying on one for all trading decisions.Trade the news in forexAs with other asset classes, forex trading news can become particularly active before and following major economic events. However, there are significant differences between the type of news that sets apart currencies from other financial markets.Forex markets tend to respond the most to macroeconomic news – the kind of developments that reflect or impact broad economies. Generally speaking, forex traders can look at economic news to assess its impact on interest rates and monetary policy​. News that suggests a more hawkish (aggressive) central bank tends to push forex pairs up in value relative to other currencies, while dovish (peaceful) news can cause a currency to depreciate.Currencies of countries that are major exporters of raw materials or commodities can be impacted by news forex trading news, as this affects the prices of the main commodities that they produce. These currencies are often referred to as resource currencies. Prices of commodities that affect these currencies can be influenced by issues affecting supply and demand.On the supply side, news that suggests a lower supply can push up prices, while news that suggests higher supply can depress prices, which can then impact related currencies. News that could reflect changes in supply may cover political tensions, wars, terrorism, weather, economic sanctions, labour relations (strikes) and more. Speculation and pricing related to demand is mainly influenced by many of the same major news releases noted above, plus commodity inventory reports and outlooks.Forex news trading strategyIn order to come up with a comprehensive forex trading strategy using news releases, forex traders tend to look out for certain key forex indicators that can have an impact on interest-rate speculation, including:Central bank decisions and speechesInflation ratesGross domestic product (GDP) figuresEmployment figuresTrade balancesNews related to market sentiment can also influence currency trading, particularly those considered to be safe havens, including the commodity gold, as well as major currencies USD, JPY and CHF. These currencies tend to attract capital during times of turmoil and see outflows when the financial markets settle down.News that can impact risk-on, risk-off trading includes stock market returns and volatility, financial stresses at the national or continental level, political turmoil, elections, treaty negotiations and other broad news beyond economic data and central banks. Recent examples include the Greek debt crisis and China market turmoil.Trade the news via Morningstar and ReutersStart with a live accountPractise with a demoForex news trading predictionsTraders should be aware that demand for many commodities – and therefore the commodity's price – rises and falls with the seasons. Seasonal forex trading news and impacts tend to be seen in energy and agricultural commodities, but less so for precious metals. The table below shows some of the main resource currencies and the commodities that affect them. These can be used by traders as a sort of forex news trading signal, as it can help to predict where the price of the currency is headed.CountryCurrency pairCommodity productCanadaUSD/CADWTI crude oil and metalsAustraliaAUD/USDBase metals and grainsNew ZealandNZD/USDLivestock and dairyNorwayUSD/NOKCrude oilsSwedenUSD/SEKMetals and forest productsSouth AfricaUSD/ZARPrecious metalsRussiaUSD/RUBCrude oil, natural gas and metalsHow to use news to trade stocksStock trading based on news releases is a strategy used by many long-term investors, as well as short-term traders. If a company has strong balance sheets, cash flows and earnings reports consistently, then a trader may decide to buy and hold the share for a longer period of time.However, if a company releases a report with considerably lower financials than expected, this can cause a rally for traders to short the stock as its value is decreasing. Traders can perform company analysis before deciding whether to invest in a stock. This includes analysing its growth rate potential, as well as any potential legal, political or insolvency risks. Financial ratios such as price/earnings along with dividend yields can also indicate whether a stock is a healthy investment right now.Our Morningstar equity research reports are updated regularly with new information about company fundamentals. These are available for a wide range of shares on our platform and can also indicate whether they are considered to be overvalued, fairly valued or undervalued within the stock market. This information may help traders to make a decision on whether to enter a position or not. Register for a live account now to access our Morningstar reports.In general, news that has a significant impact on individual company shares may not have a major impact on currencies. Stock market news that has little or no impact on currencies includes earnings reports, management changes, mergers and acquisitions and partnerships. Therefore, it may be easier for some to make more reliable forex news trading predictions on how the market will perform.News trading signalsSome brokers offer automated news trading signals that can help a trader to make decisions on whether to enter, exit or avoid a trade. These hints are based on price fluctuations after a certain type of news release and can prompt traders to either buy or sell an asset.A manual alternative is to monitor upcoming tradeable events using our economic calendar. This feature can be found on our Next Generation platform and highlights events such as unemployment reports, GDP, CPI and PPI figures, as well as trade reports and sentiment surveys. These events can all have an effect on market sentiment and cause major price swings within the financial markets.Our market calendar can be customised by date, market impact (low to high) and country, so you can filter these to be more relevant for the asset or market that you are interested in trading. You can also set alerts for individual events that you wish to monitor.Trading news releases: what are the benefits?It can help to increase volatilityCertain major economic announcements can bring additional volatility in the markets, even if it is for just a short period of time. Even the neatest forex or stock chart patterns can temporarily be thrown out of sync by a significant trading announcement, such as the latest unemployment news or changes to interest rates or inflation from a nationwide bank.Paying attention to when trading announcements are due can mean that you end up placing a carefully planned trade just before a major event happens, which instantly triggers your stop-loss. It may be more opportune to wait to open new positions after news events have taken place, and then see if the reason for the trade is still valid.It can trigger unexpected market reactionsThere is normally a consensus amongst leading economists about what level an economic announcement is likely to come in at. Changes to non-farm payrolls​​, GDP or inflation data will have a resulting effect on the market. For example, low unemployment suggests a strong economy, so many would expect the stock market to rise. A decision to lower interest rates could make a country’s currency less attractive, causing it to fall against other world currencies.From time to time, however, economic announcements are very different from what the broader market was expecting, and this can cause an opposite market reaction. For example, if a central bank hints that rate cuts may be coming, but the currency still rises, there could be other factors in addition to the prospect of interest rate changes. This could, in turn, prove to be a strong 'buy' signal. If the currency does not drop on an expectation of a fall in interest rates, then positive sentiment is strong, and this could possibly indicate that it is now a buyer’s market.It can indicate that trends are changingMany traders try to identify trends in the hope of profit. Such trends could range across minutes, days or even months. But most trends reverse at some point, and a change in the underlying economics could be the first sign of this.Every journey starts with a single step and this is true of trend reversals as well. An economic announcement is rarely enough to quickly change a medium-term trend, but how the market reacts to surprises can give the first clue that sentiment is starting to shift. This offers traders an opportunity to open positions at the very start of a new trend.Practise trading news on the goSeamlessly open and close trades, track your progress and set up alertsOpen a demo accountLearn moreRisks of news tradingOf course, there are drawbacks of news-based trading as well. In particular, news trading requires expert fundamental analysis skills, as you will need to understand how certain economic announcements can affect your positions and the wider financial market.There is also the risk of carrying positions for a longer period of time. If the news release requires a few days or weeks to materialise, your trading positions may be open over several days. This brings overnight risk and may require you to pay additional holding costs. Therefore, traders should ensure that they have sufficient funds in their account to cover these costs.How to get started trading market newsOpen an account with CMC Markets to access our multitude of news and analysis tools.

      " On paper, momentum investing seems less like an investing strategy and more like a knee-jerk reaction to market information. The idea of selling losers and buying winners is seductive, but it flies in the face of the tried and true Wall Street adage, \"buy low, sell high.\"\n",
      " In this article, we'll look at momentum investing and its benefits and pitfalls. \n",
      "Key Takeaways\n",
      "Momentum investing is a trading strategy in which investors buy securities that are rising and sell them when they look to have peaked.The goal is to work with volatility by finding buying opportunities in short-term uptrends and then sell when the securities start to lose momentum.Then, the investor takes the cash and looks for the next short-term uptrend, or buying opportunity, and repeats the process.Skilled traders understand when to enter into a position, how long to hold it for, and when to exit; they can also react to short-term, news-driven spikes or selloffs.Risks of momentum trading include moving into a position too early, closing out too late, and getting distracted and missing key trends and technical deviations.\n",
      " The Father of Momentum Investing Though not the first momentum investor, Richard Driehaus took the practice and made it into the strategy he used to run his funds. His philosophy was that more money could be made by \"buying high and selling higher\" than by buying underpriced stocks and waiting for the market to re-evaluate them.\n",
      " Driehaus believed in selling the losers and letting the winners ride while reinvesting the money from the losers in other stocks that were beginning to boil. Many of the techniques he used became the basics of what is now called momentum investing.\n",
      " Precepts of Momentum Investing Momentum investing seeks to take advantage of market volatility by taking short-term positions in stocks going up and selling them as soon as they show signs of going down. The investor then moves the capital to new positions. In this case, the market volatility is like waves in the ocean, and a momentum investor is sailing up the crest of one, only to jump to the next wave before the first wave crashes down again.\n",
      " A momentum investor looks to take advantage of investor herding by leading the pack in and being the first one to take the money and run. \n",
      " Elements of Momentum Investing Trading momentum markets require sophisticated risk management rules to address volatility, overcrowding, and hidden traps that reduce profits. Market players routinely ignore these rules, blinded by an overwhelming fear they’ll miss the rally or selloff while everyone else books windfall profits. The rules can be broken down into five elements:\n",
      " Selection, or what equities you chooseRisks revolve around the timing in opening and closing the tradesEntry timing means getting into the trade earlyPosition management couples wide spreads and your holding periodExit points require consistent charting\n",
      "To increase the likelihood of choosing an investment that is liquid and volatile, pick individual securities, rather than mutual funds or ETFs, and make sure they have an average trading volume of at least 5 million shares per day.\n",
      " Momentum Security Selection Choose liquid securities when engaging in momentum strategies. Stay away from leveraged or inverse ETFs because their price swings don’t accurately track underlying indices or futures markets due to complex fund construction. Regular funds make excellent trading vehicles but tend to grind through smaller percentage gains and losses compared with individual securities.\n",
      " Seek out securities that trade more than 5 million shares per day whenever possible. Many popular stocks meet these criteria, but even low float issues can turn into highly liquid instruments when news flow and intense emotional reactions draw in market players from diverse sources. \n",
      " Keep watch for the \"flavor of the day,\" when new products, divisions or concepts capture the public's imagination, forcing analysts to throw away calculations and re-compute profit estimates. Biotechs and small to midsize technology companies create a generous supply of these story stocks.\n",
      "Momentum trading deviates notably from the investment strategy of buying low and waiting for a stock to rise.\n",
      " Tight Risk Control The risk side of the equation must be addressed in detail, or the momentum strategy will fail. The pitfalls of momentum trading include:\n",
      "Jumping into a position too soon, before a momentum move is confirmed.\n",
      "Closing the position too late, after saturation has been reached.\n",
      "Failing to keep eyes on the screen, missing changing trends, reversals or signs of news that take the market by surprise.\n",
      "Keeping a position open overnight. Stocks are particularly susceptible to external factors occurring after the close of that day's trading—these factors could cause radically different prices and patterns the next day.\n",
      "Failing to act quickly to close a bad position, thereby riding the momentum train the wrong way down the tracks.\n",
      " Perfect Entry Timing The best momentum trades come when a news shock hits, triggering rapid movement from one price level to another. In turn, this sets off buying or selling signals for observant players who jump in and are rewarded with instant profits. Another batch of momentum capital enters as the trade evolves, generating counter swings that shake out weak hands. The hot money population finally hits an extreme, triggering volatile whipsaws and major reversals.\n",
      " Early positions offer the greatest reward with the least risk while aging trends should be avoided at all costs. The opposite happens in real-world scenarios because most traders don't see the opportunity until late in the cycle and then fail to act until everyone else jumps in.\n",
      " Position Management Position management takes time to master because these securities often carry wide bid/ask spreads. Wide spreads require larger movement in your favor to reach profitability while also grinding through wide intraday ranges that expose stops—even though technicals remain intact.\n",
      " Choose your holding period wisely because risk increases the longer you stay positioned. Day trading works well with momentum strategies, but it forces players to take larger positions to compensate for the greater profit potential of multi-day holds. Conversely, it is best to reduce position size when holding through multiple sessions to allow for greater movement and stop placement further away from the current action.\n",
      " Profitable Exits Exit when the price is moving rapidly into an overextended technical state. This overextended state is often identified by a series of vertical bars on the 60-minute chart. Alternately, the price could pierce the third or fourth standard deviation of a top or bottom 20-day Bollinger Band.\n",
      " Tighten up stops or consider a blind exit when technical barriers are hit like a major trendline or previous high/low. Exit or take partial profits when crossovers signal potential trend changes.\n",
      " Benefits of Momentum Investing Momentum investing can turn into large profits for the trader who has the right personality, can handle the risks involved, and can dedicate themselves to sticking to the strategy.\n",
      " Potential for High Profits Over a Short Period There are lucrative profits to be made from momentum investing. For example, say you buy a stock that grows from $50 to $75 based upon an overly positive analyst report. You then sell at a profit of 50% before the stock price corrects itself. You've made a 50% return over the course of a few weeks or months (not an annualized return). Over time, the profit potential increase using momentum investing can be staggeringly large.\n",
      " Leveraging the Market's Volatility to Your Advantage The key to momentum investing is being able to capitalize on volatile market trends. Momentum investors look for stocks to invest in that are on their way up and then sell them before the prices start to go back down. For such investors, being ahead of the pack is a way to maximize return on investment (ROI).\n",
      " Leveraging the Emotional Decisions of Other Investors According to Ben Carlson of the blog, A Wealth of Common Sense, the entire idea of momentum investing is built around chasing performance. However, momentum investors do this in a systematic way that includes a specific buying point and selling point. Rather than be controlled by emotional responses to stock prices like many investors are, momentum investors seek to take advantage of the changes in stock prices caused by emotional investors.\n",
      " Drawbacks of Momentum Investing However, for every silver-lined cloud, there may also be rain. Momentum investing also has several downsides. The same risk-return tradeoff that exists with other investing strategies also plays a hand in momentum investing.\n",
      " Like a boat trying to sail on the crests of waves, a momentum investor is always at risk of timing a buy incorrectly and ending up underwater. Most momentum investors accept this risk as payment for the possibility of higher returns.\n",
      " High Turnover High stock turnover can be expensive in terms of fees. Even though low-cost brokers are slowly putting an end to the problem of high fees, this is still a major concern for most rookie momentum traders. \n",
      " Time Intensive Momentum investors have to monitor market details daily, if not hourly. Because they are dealing with stocks that will crest and go down again, they need to jump in early and get out fast. This means watching all the updates to see if there is any negative news that will spook investors. \n",
      " Market Sensitive Momentum investing works best in a bull market because investors tend to herd a lot more. In a bear market, the margin for profit on momentum investing shrinks in accordance with increased investor caution.\n",
      " Will It Work for You? Momentum investing can work, but it may not be practical for all investors. As an individual investor, practicing momentum investing will most likely lead to overall portfolio losses. When you purchase a rising stock or sell a falling stock, you will be reacting to older news than the professionals at the head of the momentum investing funds.\n",
      " They will get out and leave you and other unlucky folks holding the bag. If you do manage to time it right, you will still have to be more conscious of the fees from turnover and how much they will eat up your returns. \n",
      " The Bottom Line Momentum trading is not for everyone, but it can often lead to impressive returns if handled properly. It takes severe discipline to trade in this type of style because trades must be closed at the first sign of weakness and the funds must be immediately placed into a different trade that is exhibiting strength.\n",
      " Factors, such as commissions, have made this type of trading impractical for many traders, but this story is slowly changing as low-cost brokers take on a more influential role in the trading careers of short-term active traders. Buying high and selling higher is momentum traders' enviable goal, but this goal does not come without its fair share of challenges.\n",

      "1. Strict Risk Control: Implement strict risk management techniques such as setting stop-loss orders to limit downside risk. This can help to minimize losses in a losing trade.\n",
      "2. Perfect Entry Timing: Understand when to enter a position, how long to hold it for, and when to exit. Reacting to short-term, news-driven spikes or sell-offs can help in this regard.\n",
      "3. Position Management: This involves managing the holding period and the size of the position. It requires time to master as these securities often carry wide bid/ask spreads. Choose your holding period wisely because risk increases the longer you stay positioned. \n",
      "4. Profitable Exits: Identify exit points and stick to them. These can be set by consistent charting or when the price is moving rapidly into an overextended technical state.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, momentum trading can be a profitable strategy when executed correctly, but it also carries significant risks. Proper risk management techniques are critical for mitigating losses and preserving capital.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Momentum trading involves buying securities that are rising and selling them when they appear to have peaked. The goal is to work with volatility by finding buying opportunities in short-term uptrends and then selling when the securities start to lose momentum. \n",
      "\n",
      "Key risks of this strategy include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Entering a position too early, before a momentum move is confirmed.\n",
      "2. Closing the position too late, after saturation has been reached.\n",
      "3. Missing changing trends, reversals, or signs of news that take the market by surprise.\n",
      "4. Keeping a position open overnight, which exposes the trader to external factors occurring after the close of that day's trading that could cause radically different prices and patterns the next day.\n",
      "5. Failing to act quickly to close a bad position, thereby riding the momentum train the wrong way down the tracks.\n",
