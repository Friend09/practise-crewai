His keenness to learn and stay updated on latest tools, technologies and trends makes him an outstanding team member. He has a very organized way of approaching release plans, which is reflective on his deliveries. I am confident that he would be a valuable asset on any project that he would onboard. It has been a pleasure working with you Raghu.”\n",

His commitment to continuous learning for himself and freely sharing it with others to move projects forward in the most collaborative fashion consistently distinguishes him from all others. His low key friendly and engaging demeanor combined with an impressive array of skill sets as a BA has made him into one of the BA group’s “go-to” resources. From Waterfall to all things Agile, he has what you need. Raghu, in short, is a highly prized asset on any team lucky enough to have him.”\n",
